One of the main issues is the 20-40% incidence of restenosis of the dilated vessel. Up to now, the subject of predictors of restenosis has not yet been sufficiently clarified. Our study is concerned with two questions; first, is it possible to prove any connections between the amount of restenosis and psychosocial factors? Second, is it possible to distinguish groups of patients with and without subsequent restenosis on the basis of psychosocial variables, even before the diagnostic coronary angiography? 138 (91m, 47f) patients were assessed before the diagnostic coronarangiography, the 25 PTCA-patients (20m, 5f) were furthermore reassessed three months after the PTCA (the time of the angiographic control). Somatic and social data were collected and a semistandardised interview was conducted. In addition, coping, stress-coping control over disease and health and life-contentment were determined. Highly significant correlations was found between the amount of restenosis and resignative stress-coping, self-pity, depressive coping and flight-tendency.

Symptoms consistently loading on an endogeneity factor are: 1) lacking in reactivity to environmental changes; 2)showing no interest in life; 3) retarded (slow, feeling tired, etc.); 4) feeling unable to act; 5) considering self lazy; 6) feeling helpless and powerless; and 7) perceiving depression as qualitatively different from ordinary sadness. Symptoms consistently loading on a reactivity factor are: 1) feeling that he or she is bearing troubles; 2) presence of precipitating stress; 3) crediting problems to excessive family and/or job responsiblitiies; 4) expressing concern for welfare of family and friends; 5) visceral symptoms; 6) feeling at ""end of rope""; 7) having middle-of-the-night insomnia; and 8) showing self-pity.

The subjects were 88 neuromuscular disease patients (30 Parkinson disease (PD), 25 cerebellar disease (CER), 7 multiple sclerosis (MS), 7 neuropathy (NEU), 10 motor neuron disease (MND), 9 myopathy (MYO)). The control subjects were 12 normal young persons and 10 normal aged persons. Postural tremor was detected by accelerator sensor. Postural tremor was recorded under the two postural conditions: The subjects maintained the index finger without or with a weight load of 50 g in a horizontal position while looking at a visual target in front of the tip of the index finger. The power spectrum was calculated by an auto-regressive model (AR model). The peak frequency and the peak power were evaluated under the two conditions. Two frequency components of 8-12 Hz and 20-25 Hz appeared in the postural tremor of both normal subjects and neuromuscular disease patients. The difference of the postural tremor between the subjects mainly appeared in the 8-12 Hz component during the postural tremor with a weight load. MYO patients belonged to one group (called as group P1) due to lower peak power, CER patients belonged to one group (called as group P2) due to higher peak power, and PD and MS patients belonged to one group (called as group P3) due to lower peak frequency and higher peak power. NER and MND patients belonged to one group (called as group N which meant normal group). These results suggested that the peak frequency and the peak power of the 8-12 Hz component were changed by the conditions of both spinal reflex system and central nervous system. An oscillator within the central nervous system produced the underlying frequency of 8-12 Hz component, while the amplitude of 8-12 Hz component was governed by both spinal reflex system and central nervous system. In conclusion, the classification of postural tremor for neuromuscular disease patients was a useful index to elucidate the mechanism of tremor oscillation and to assist in clinical diagnosis of neuromuscular disease.",2002-Jun,Adult;Central Nervous System/physiology;Female;Fingers/physiology;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Neuromuscular Diseases/classification*:diagnosis;Periodicity;Posture*;Reference Values;Tremor/physiopathology*,Journal Article,Electromyography and clinical neurophysiology,

They had initially presented with plasma glucose levels of 37.8 +/- 19.3 mmol/l. Baseline clinical metabolic and 8-year prospective data were obtained (51 men and 28 women, mean age 45 +/- 10 years, islet-cell or GAD antibody negative). After hospitalization and intensive outpatient treatment, near-normoglycemic remission (fasting plasma glucose 6.1 +/- 0.83 mmol/l and HbA1c 0.95 +/- 0.10 of upper limit of normal) occurred within 8 +/- 10 months of insulin or sulfonylurea therapy. This was unrelated to the resolution of stress or significant weight loss (1.9 +/- 4.97 kg). Metabolic studies performed during remission showed 17% normal, 33% impaired, and 50% diabetic glucose tolerance. Glucose disposal (1 mU x kg-1 x min-1) euglycemic insulin clamp with D-[3(-3)H]glucose) was higher in the normal glucose tolerance group compared with the impaired and diabetic groups (37.8 +/- 10.2 vs. 26.1 +/- 10.7 and 26.7 +/- 12.0 micromol x kg-1 x min-1; P < 0.05) despite similar BMIs in all three groups (28.8 +/- 3.7 kg/m2). Insulin secretion was below the normal range. Of 79 patients, 27 relapsed. A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis gives a median time of 40 months to relapse. Higher presenting plasma glucose and male sex predicted earlier relapse. Near-normoglycemic remission may occur in up to 30% of black new-onset NIDDM patients.

Useful lateral pinch can be provided to patients with at least wrist extension control preserved by use of a combination of flexor pollicis longus tenodesis or transfer and carpometacarpal and inter phalangeal joint stabilization. In patients who retain function in the brachioradialis, extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis, pronator teres, and flexor carpi radialis, strong grasp as well as effective lateral pinch can be restored to the hand by surgery. Thumb control for flexion and extension is provided by tendon transfer to the flexor pollicis longus and tenodesis or transfer to the extensor pollicis longus. Proper positioning for lateral pinch can be accomplished by either arthrodesis of the first metacarpal-trapezial joint or tendon transfer to restore adduction-opposition to the thumb. The surgical concepts presented in this paper have been applied to the functional reconstruction of the hands of more than 50 patients with spinal cord injury during the last 15 years.

23,24.0,9628275.0,Obesity,Obesity,None,0,0,Insulin-induced vasodilatation and endothelial function in obesity/insulin resistance. Effects of troglitazone.,"Insulin resistance is associated with a decreased vasodilator response to insulin. Because insulin's vasodilator effect is nitric oxide dependent, this impairment may reflect endothelial dysfunction. Troglitazone, an insulin-sensitiser, might thus improve insulin-dependent and/or endothelium-dependent vascular function in insulin resistant obese subjects. For 8 weeks, fifteen obese subjects were treated with either 400 mg troglitazone once daily or placebo, in a randomised, double-blind, cross-over design. At the end of each treatment period, we measured forearm vasodilator responses (plethysmography) to intra-arterial administered acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside; insulin sensitivity and insulin-induced vascular and neurohumoral responses (clamp); vasoconstrictor responses to NC-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) during hyperinsulinaemia; and ambulatory 24-h blood pressure (ABPM). Baseline data (placebo) of obese subjects were compared with those obtained in lean control subjects. Obese subjects were insulin resistant compared with leans (whole-body glucose uptake: 26.8+/-3.0 vs. 53.9+/-4.3 [tmol kgl min-, p < 0.001). Troglitazone improved whole-body glucose uptake (to 31.9+/-3.3 micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1) , p=0.028), and forearm glucose uptake (from 1.09+/-0.54 to 2.31+/-0.69 micromol dL(-1) x min(-1), p=0.006). Insulin-induced vasodilatation was blunted in obese subjects (percent increase in forearm blood flow (FBF) in lean 66.5+/-23.0%, vs. 10.1+/-11.3% in obese, p=0.04), but did not improve during troglitazone. Vascular responses to acetylcholine, sodium nitroprusside and L-NMMA did not differ between the obese and lean group, nor between both treatment periods in the obese individuals.

24,25.0,165063.0,Obesity,Body Weight;Obesity,None,0,0,Effects of age and obesity on insulin binding to isolated adipocytes.,"We have measured insulin binding to isolated adipocytes prepared from rats of varying ages and body weights. The ability of adipocytes to bind insulin progressively decreases as animals get older and fatter until about 70 days of age and 300 g body weight are reached. From this point on further decreases in insulin binding to adipocytes were not seen as rats got older and fatter. Analysis of the data indicated that this decrease in insulin binding could be accounted for by decreased numbers of insulin receptor sites per cell. Further studies were conducted in which animals were allowed to age, but obesity was prevented or reversed by hypocaloric diets. In these experiments decreased insulin binding was either prevented or restored to normal by the negative caloric state, indicating that age had no appreciable effect on the ability of adipocytes to bind insulin. The influence of the obesity associated variables-hyperinsulinemia and increased fat cell size-on insulin binding was also examined. These latter studies are consistent with the concept that elevated in vivo plasma insulin levels lead to decreased insulin receptors, and further suggest a role for additonal factors in regulating the adipocyte insulin receptor. In conclusion: 1. Decreased insulin binding to adipocytes is closely related to the obese state. 2. This decrease in insulin binding can be accounted for by decreased numbers of receptor sites per cell, and 3. The mecahnism(s) underlying this decreased insulin binding are complex and probably represents an effect of more than one variable.",1975-Jun,"Adipose Tissue/metabolism*;Aging*;Animals;Binding Sites;Body Weight;Cell Membrane/metabolism;Fasting;Insulin/metabolism*;Insulin Antibodies;Kinetics;Liver/metabolism;Male;Obesity/metabolism*;Organ Specificity;Protein Binding;Rats;Receptors, Cell Surface*","In Vitro,Journal Article,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",Endocrinology,"Insulin,Insulin Antibodies,Receptors, Cell Surface"

Over 5 years, 7,364 patients of all ages underwent ambulatory 24-hour electrocardiographic (Holter) monitoring using a 2-channel recorder. Of these, 1,512 (20.5%) were referred because of syncope. During monitoring, 15 patients had syncope and 7 of the episodes were related to an arrhythmia, usually ventricular tachycardia. Presyncope was reported in 241 patients, with a related arrhythmia in 24. Thus, an arrhythmia-related symptom that could be diagnostic was present in only 2% of the patients monitored. However, syncope or presyncope without an associated arrhythmia might be considered a negative diagnostic clue and occurred in 225 (15%). High-grade atrioventricular block was present in 15 and ventricular tachycardia in 116; only 6 (5%) reported associated symptoms. An age-related incremental increase in atrial and ventricular arrhythmias was found. In 415 of the 1,004 patients (41%) aged 60 years or more, arrhythmias that are conventionally associated with sinoatrial disease were recorded. Using stringent diagnostic criteria, the sick sinus or tachybradycardia syndrome was present in 33 (3%). Many older patients (70%) were taking drugs that could be arrhythmogenic, hypotensive or both. It is concluded that an open referral 24-hour ambulatory monitoring service rarely results in identifying relevant symptom-related arrhythmias in patients with syncope. It records many asymptomatic arrhythmias that can compound rather than resolve the diagnostic problem in older patients, because the data obtained could lead to unnecessary therapy.

A practical approach in applying magnetic resonance imaging to the indeterminate solitary bone lesion is outlined in this article, which serves as a guideline for logical and consistent application of MR imaging for this purpose. Although seemingly widely used, gadolinium appears to add little to the diagnostic sensitivity of specificity of MR with respect to solitary bone lesions. For selective tumors, such as osteosarcoma, gadolinium offers the potential for determining the efficacy of chemotherapy, by evaluating tumor necrosis prior and subsequent to chemotherapy. In select situations, especially sarcomas close to joints, gadolinium may aid and augment other pulse sequences in determining whether tumor resection should be intra- or extra-articular. However, gadolinium has a limited role in the evaluation of the solitary bone tumor, and its use should be the exception rather than the rule.",1997-Aug,"Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use;Bone Neoplasms/diagnosis*:therapy;Contrast Media*;Drug Combinations;Edema/diagnosis;Evaluation Studies as Topic;Gadolinium/diagnostic use*;Gadolinium DTPA;Humans;Image Enhancement;Joint Diseases/diagnosis:surgery;Magnetic Resonance Imaging*;Meglumine/diagnostic use;Muscle, Skeletal/pathology;Muscular Diseases/diagnosis;Necrosis;Neoplasm Staging;Organometallic Compounds/diagnostic use;Osteosarcoma/diagnosis:therapy;Pentetic Acid/analogs & derivatives:diagnostic use;Sarcoma/diagnosis:surgery;Sensitivity and Specificity;Treatment Outcome",Journal Article,"Seminars in ultrasound, CT, and MR","Antineoplastic Agents,Contrast Media,Drug Combinations,Organometallic Compounds,Meglumine,Pentetic Acid,Gadolinium,Gadolinium DTPA"

This, together with the data obtained after comparison of the proportion of cataleptic animals in the progeny from homogeneous crossings between rats of normal and cataleptic phenotypes from the group selected for catalepsy (16 and 48%, respectively), makes one suppose predisposition to catalepsy to be an oligogenic character. The later onset of stereotype-like reactions to administrations of methylphenidate, and their longer persistence in cataleptic animals points to inertness of dopaminergic systems. At the same time, the increased frequency of ""hyperactivity""-like reactions to methylphenidate, as well as higher arterial pressure and lower frequency of defecations seem to reflect an increased excitability of noradrenergic brain systems in rats predisposed to catalepsy.",1983-Dec,"Animals;Autonomic Nervous System/physiopathology;Catalepsy/genetics*:physiopathology;Crosses, Genetic;Disease Susceptibility;Female;Humans;Male;Methylphenidate/pharmacology;Motor Activity/drug effects;Rats;Rats, Inbred Strains/genetics*;Selection, Genetic*","English Abstract,Journal Article",Genetika,Methylphenidate

In this study, we examined consumption of complex carbohydrates (cornstarch and Polycose) and fats (soybean oil and margarine) in mice from two inbred strains, C57BL/6ByJ and 129P3/J. At lower concentrations of liquid nutrients tested using two-bottle tests, when the amounts consumed had negligible energy content, the C57BL/6ByJ mice had higher acceptance of Polycose and soybean oil. This was probably due to strain differences in chemosensory perception of Polycose and oil. At higher concentrations, the mice consumed a substantial part of their daily energy from the macronutrient sources, however, there were no or only small strain differences in nutrient consumption. These small differences were probably due to strain variation in body size. The two strains also did not differ in chow intake. Despite similar energy intakes, access to the nutrients resulted in greater body weight (BW) gain in the C57BL/6ByJ mice than in the 129P3/J mice. The diet-induced weight gain was examined in detail in groups of 2-month-old C57BL/6ByJ and 129P3/J mice given ether chow, or chow and margarine to eat. Access to margarine did not increase total energy consumption of either strain. It increased BW and adiposity of the C57BL/6ByJ mice, but only after they reached the age of approximately 3 months. There were no differences in BW and adiposity between control and margarine-exposed 129P3/J mice.

Sex hormone dysregulation and altered insulin sensitivity have also been implicated. Two compounds, orlistat and sibutramine, have been shown to help prevent weight gain following a hypocaloric diet, but orlistat requires compliance with a fat-reduced diet, and sibutramine is unsuitable for patients taking serotonergic agents. The weight reducing effect of fluoxetine, even in conjunction with a hypocaloric diet, is only transient. Topiramate, amantadine and metformin may have adverse side-effects potentially outweighing the weight reducing potential. The effectiveness of cimetidine and nizatedine remains unclear. The hazards of these agents in a psychiatric population are discussed. It is concluded that the current evidence does not support the general use of pharmacological interventions for overweight patients treated with antipsychotic medication, although individually selected patients may benefit.",2002-Jul,Amantadine/adverse effects;Antipsychotic Agents/adverse effects*:therapeutic use;Cimetidine/adverse effects;Cyclobutanes/adverse effects;Fluoxetine/adverse effects;Fructose/adverse effects:analogs & derivatives*;Humans;Lactones/adverse effects;Metformin/adverse effects;Nizatidine/adverse effects;Obesity/chemically induced*:drug therapy;Weight Gain/drug effects,"Journal Article,Review",International clinical psychopharmacology,"Antipsychotic Agents,Cyclobutanes,Lactones,topiramate,Fructose,Cimetidine,Fluoxetine,Metformin,Amantadine,Nizatidine,orlistat,sibutramine"

For example, functional foods have been studied for the prevention of osteoporosis, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. They have yet to be related to the prevention of obesity, although obesity is one of the major health problems today. The inclusion of foods or the replacement of habitual foods with others that may enhance energy expenditure (EE) or improve satiety may be a practical way to maintain a stable body weight or assist in achieving weight loss; such foods may act as functional foods in body weight control. Some foods that might be classified as functional foods for weight control because of their effects on EE and appetite-including medium-chain triacylglycerols, diacylglycerols, tea, milk, and nuts-are reviewed here. Only human studies reporting EE, appetite, or body weight are discussed. When studies of whole food items are unavailable, studies of nutraceuticals, the capsular equivalents of functional foods, are reviewed. To date, dietary fats seem to be most promising and have been the most extensively studied for their effects on body weight control. However, the weight loss observed is small and should be considered mostly as a measure to prevent weight gain. Carefully conducted clinical studies are needed to firmly ascertain the effect of tea, milk, and nuts on body weight maintenance, to assess their potential to assist in weight-loss efforts, and to ascertain dose-response relations and mechanisms of action for the 4 food types examined.",2005-Jan,Animals;Body Weight/drug effects*;Diet*;Dietary Fats/administration & dosage:pharmacology*;Female;Humans;Male;Milk*;Nuts*;Obesity/diet therapy*;Tea*;Triglycerides*/administration & dosage:metabolism:pharmacology,"Journal Article,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Review",The American journal of clinical nutrition,"Dietary Fats,Tea,Triglycerides"

The purpose of this study was to determine if ultrasonography could distinguish between a paralyzed and normally functioning diaphragm. We predicted that a paralyzed diaphragm would be atrophic and not shorten, therefore it would be thin and not thicken during inspiration. Thirty subjects (five with bilateral diaphragm paralysis, seven with unilateral diaphragm paralysis, three with inspiratory weakness but normally functioning diaphragms, and 15 healthy control subjects) had diaphragm ultrasound performed with a 7.5 to 10.0 MHz transducer placed over the lower rib cage in the mid-axillary line. The thickness of the diaphragm (tdi) was measured to the nearest 0.1 mm at FRC (t(di)FRC) and TLC (t(di)TLC). Diaphragm thickening during inspiration (delta t(di)) was calculated as (t(di)TLC - t(di)FRC)/t(di)FRC. In patients with unilateral paralysis, t(di) and delta t(di) for the paralyzed hemidiaphragm were significantly less than those values for the normally functioning hemidiaphragm (1.7 +/- 0.2 mm versus 2.7 +/- 0.5 mm [mean + SD] p < 0.01 for t(di), and -8.5 +/- 13% versus 65 +/- 26% [p < 0.001] for delta t(di)).

The properties of GABAA receptors, obtained from cortex and cerebellum 30 days following gonadectomy, and the affinity of muscimol and bicuculline for cortical and cerebellar GABA binding sites were also studied. While young rats failed to show sex differences, the threshold doses of bicuculline producing the first myoclonic twitch and running/bouncing clonus (RB clonus) were lower in adult male than female rats. Fifteen days after gonadectomy or sham operation male rats needed less bicuculline to the onset of myoclonic twitch and RB clonus than identically treated females, while orchidectomized rats needed more bicuculline to the onset of tonic hindlimb extension than all other groups examined. All sex differences disappeared 30 days following gonadectomy. At the same time, in males gonadectomy decreased the affinity and enhanced the density of cortical 3H-muscimol binding sites. In female rats, gonadectomy only decreased the affinity of cortical GABAA receptors. Only regional but not sex differences were observed in the affinity of muscimol and bicuculline for GABAA receptors.

Local paralysis of the EDL muscle was induced by s.c. injections of BoNT serotypes A, B, E or F over the anterior tibialis muscle. One to 14 days later, the rats were anesthetized with urethane, and isometric twitch tensions following stimulation of the peroneal nerve were measured in situ.

Quality morphometric analyses of axonal atrophy and swelling.,"Quantitative morphometric analysis was used to characterize expression of myelinated axon swelling and atrophy in rat peripheral nerve during 2,5-hexanedione (HD) intoxication. HD was administered by gavage according to different daily dosing regiments (100, 175, 250, or 400 mg/kg/day) and four proximodistal nerve regions (5th lumbar spinal nerve, proximal and distal sciatic nerve, and tibial nerve) were examined morphometrically. Morphometric determinations were made at four behavioral endpoints (unaffected, slight, moderate, and severe toxicity) and were correlated to electrophysiologic measurements of peripheral nerve function. Results show that, for all HD dose rates, onsets of behavioral neurotoxicity and nerve dysfunction were generally related to development of abundant axon atrophy. The proximodistal manifestation of atrophy was dependent upon the dosing rate; i.e., the atrophy response produced by subacute intoxication with higher daily dosing rates (250 and 400 mg/kg/day) was restricted to distal nerve regions whereas subchronic induction with lower dosing rates (100 and 175 mg/kg/day) produced abundant fiber atrophy in all proximodistal areas. In contrast to atrophy, axonal swellings constituted an inconsistent minor morphologic response, the expression of which was dependent upon subchronic dosing rates (100-250 mg/kg/day). Subacute HD administration (400 mg/kg/day) produced significant changes in neurobehavior and nerve electrophysiologic parameters in the absence of peripheral axon swelling. Thus, conditional expression of swellings suggests they are an epiphenomenon related to low-dose induction rates. Fiber atrophy, however, was numerically dominant, correlated with nerve dysfunction, and occurred at all dosing levels.

Several complications of PNH during pregnancy, could be prevented; chronic anemia, folate and iron deficiency, deep vein thrombosis. We report seven pregnancies, six of which were successful in four patients. One pregnancy was terminated after 25 weeks by a fetal death during an acute hemolytic crisis. Diagnosis of PNH was made in the four patients before the pregnancy by the acidified serum lysis assay and the sucrose lysis assay. During puerperium, acute hemolytic crisis, most probably triggered by delivery, were observed in two patients. Thrombotic complications could be prevented by early initiation of an anticoagulant therapy after delivery. The only neonatal complication, observed in two cases was iso immune hemolytic anemia related to the multiple blood transfusions received before and during pregnancy. These results show that successful pregnancies are possible in PNH women when monitoring is especially close. To allow optimal fetal development, patients were transfused with saline-washed or frozen-thawed packed red-cells to prevent the precipitation of hemolysis, so that the hemoglobin level remained higher than 10 g/dl. During the whole pregnancy, patients had to be given dietary supplementation with folic acid and iron therapy whenever deficiency was demonstrated, under close surveillance of hemolysis. To prevent thrombotic complications during pregnancy, anticoagulant therapy was used if the patients had to be bedridden, or within 8 hours following delivery.",1987,"Adult;Androgens/therapeutic use;Birth Weight;Blood Transfusion;Cesarean Section;Female;Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal/physiopathology*:therapy;Humans;Infant, Newborn;Pregnancy;Pregnancy Complications, Hematologic/physiopathology*:therapy","English Abstract,Journal Article","Journal de gyn¨¦cologie, obst¨¦trique et biologie de la reproduction",Androgens

When started at the age of 8 weeks or 5 weeks, treatment of SHR and WKY with GVG (150 mg/kg, s.c.) for several weeks did not influence systolic blood pressure. In 1-week old SHR, treatment with GVG (up to 150 mg/kg, s.c.) abolished the rise in blood pressure until animals were 8 weeks old. Thereafter, arterial blood pressure started to increase but it remained distinctly lower than that in untreated animals. When started at the age of 1 week, treatment with GVG for 7 weeks did not influence arterial blood pressure in WKY. GVG delayed increase in body weight in SHR and WKY, irrespective of their age. GVG greatly increased GABA levels in the hypothalamus, frontal cortex, brainstem and rest of the brain in both WKY and SHR.

Fasting serum samples were analyzed in 34 subjects with PCOS, of whom 22 were obese (body mass index [BMI]>27 kg/m2), and in 40 normal control women, of whom 20 were obese. Women with PCOS exhibited a significantly (P<.02) higher mean serum TNFalpha concentration compared with the controls. The serum TNFalpha level and BMI were directly correlated in women with PCOS (r=.48, P<.005) and highly correlated in controls (r=.78, P<.001). When subjects were classified by body weight, the mean serum TNFalpha concentration was significantly (P<.001) elevated in normal-weight women with PCOS compared with normal-weight controls. On the other hand, mean serum TNFalpha concentrations in obese women with PCOS and obese controls were similar and significantly (P<.02) higher than in normal-weight women with PCOS. A direct correlation between serum fasting insulin and TNFalpha was evident in controls (r=.35, P<.03), but not in women with PCOS. However, in the subgroup of obese women with PCOS, fasting insulin directly correlated (r=.49, P<.03) with TNFalpha and the median fasting serum insulin concentration was significantly (P<.05) higher compared with the level in normal-weight women with PCOS and all controls. Fasting insulin and TNFalpha were no longer correlated in controls as a group and in obese women with PCOS when controlling for body weight. Serum TNFalpha did not correlate with luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone (T), or dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) in women with PCOS. However, serum insulin was significantly correlated (r=.49, P<.0004) with T and the BMI exhibited a trend for correlation with serum T (r=.33, P=.05) in women with PCOS. Finally, the mean serum LH concentration was significantly (P<.02) higher in normal-weight women with PCOS versus obese women with PCOS, and serum LH levels exhibited a trend for an inverse correlation with the BMI (r=.31, P=.09) in women with PCOS. We conclude that (1) serum TNFalpha is increased in normal-weight women with PCOS and is even higher in obese individuals regardless of whether they have PCOS; (2) factors other than obesity are the cause of elevated serum TNFalpha in normal-weight women with PCOS; and (3) whereas increased circulating TNFalpha may mediate insulin resistance in obesity, which may in turn promote hyperandrogenism in obese women with PCOS, it remains to be demonstrated whether this is also the case in normal-weight women with PCOS.",1999-Apr,Adult;Body Mass Index;Body Weight/physiology;Female;Humans;Obesity/blood;Polycystic Ovary Syndrome/blood*:physiopathology;Testosterone/blood;Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism*,"Clinical Trial,Journal Article",Metabolism: clinical and experimental,"Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha,Testosterone"

Several investigators have reported that muscle entrapment of branches of the third division of the trigeminal nerve may result in orofacial sensory disruption. Different theories have been suggested to illustrate how TMD and trauma might be associated with these neurological changes. Additionally, several mechanisms exist to explain how muscle spasms may be responsible for nerve compression in individuals with normal anatomy and in those with anatomical variations.

Adopting Horner's (1990) definition of what is meant by 'aversive' in the ideological debate, it is suggested that the crucial issue is the inability of making clients to give their informed consent. It is proposed that proxy consent might be an alternative, but that this would be unacceptable if aversive procedures could be shown to be never in the best interests of the client, or shown to violate clients' rights or to be against the interests of society because of anticipated harm or injustice to others. It is concluded that it is difficult to be certain that it is ever in the best interests of the client for aversive procedures to be employed, that aversive interventions appear not to violate clients' rights necessarily (except possibly the right to dignity and respect while the intervention is operating, and perhaps the right to choice at the beginning of the intervention), but that the inescapable difficulty in the use of aversive interventions is the likelihood that they will be misused with other clients than the ones for whom they may be initially designed.",1993-Jun,"Aversive Therapy/legislation & jurisprudence:standards*;Electroshock;Ethics, Professional;Female;Humans;Informed Consent;Intellectual Disability/psychology:rehabilitation:therapy*;Legal Guardians;Male;Patient Advocacy*;Self-Injurious Behavior/prevention & control","Journal Article,Review",Journal of intellectual disability research : JIDR,

This action consisted in the almost disappearance of trauma-induced hyperalgesia or a significant reduction of visceral stimulation-induced hypalgesia without any significant changes in movement reactivity depression typical to these states. Moreover, analysis or morphines influence on movement reactivity depression in free behaving rats of different groups or parts of one group previously housed in different aversive conditions allow to understand the reasons of variability in the action of opiates and the significance of previous living conditions in determination of their effects. Furthermore, the enhancement of morphines action on movement reactivity 3-4 hours after a single naloxone administration was observed, which indicates the possibility of artificial regulation of opiate effects by direct action on opiate receptors by naloxone. Subchronic naloxone administration (0.5 mg/kg, 3 times per day for 3 days) led to substantial and longterm enhancement of morphines depressive effect on movement reactivity (20 and 105 hours after the last naloxone use) and to decrease in movement reactivity depression typical to restraint stress.",1989-Apr,"Analgesics*;Animals;Behavior, Animal/drug effects;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Male;Morphine/pharmacology*;Motor Activity/drug effects*;Pain/drug therapy:metabolism*;Rats;Rats, Inbred Strains",Journal Article,The International journal of neuroscience,"Analgesics,Morphine"

Hexoestrol administration induced almost complete thymic atrophy and partial involution of the peripheral lymphoid tissues. Greater resistance to toxoplasmic infection was found in the gonadectomized mice than in controls of both sexes, possibly due to a better cell-mediated immunity in the gonadectomized animals. Overwhelming toxoplasmosis with increased mortality was found in the hexoestrol-treated mice after infection, probably resulting from a depression of cell-mediated immunity caused by hexoestrol.

Objective assessment of the escape of urine is essential for assessment of the degree of incontinence or for evaluation of the therapeutic results. Therefore a simple standard test was elaborated which can be used for the objective measurement of urinary losses in all patients. The International Continence Society (I.C.S.) recommended in 1983 a one-hour test for objective assessment of escape of urine. The latter assesses the loss of urine by weighing pads or dispers before and after standard activities. The authors tried in their clinical department to assess the significance of a modified 40-minute test in women with urinary incontinence--it was only 44%.

These studies document the reduction in mental retardation, learning difficulties and behaviour problems associated with neonatal screening. They also describe other behavioural changes resulting from these disorders. Some behavioural changes are transient or preventable with early diagnosis and treatment, whereas some appear to be irreversible, reflecting permanent brain effects of abnormalities associated with the disease. Despite the variety of disorders studied, there are commonalities in approach and issues, including a developmental neuropsychological perspective resulting in behavioural assessments specific to the disorder and its likely manifestations, a recognition that behaviour may change across time in association with brain development and an understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying the behavioural changes. Assessments go beyond IQ, and include specific intellectual abilities, social behaviour, temperament, behaviour problems and identity. Behavioural changes are related to specific characteristics of the disease and its treatment, including the timing of exposure to abnormal hormones and/or neurotransmitters, the severity of the disease, and the age at initiation and adequacy of treatment. These studies provide information about the ways in which hormones and neurotransmitters affect the development and ongoing function of the brain, and an understanding of the ways in which neonatal screening results in improved psychological outcome.

Evoked potential (EVP) thresholds were measured before and after the noise exposures. Experimental animals received 10 days of exposure to an octave band noise (OBN) centered at 0.5 kHz OBN at 95 dB SPL (6 h on/18 h off) and allowed to recover for 5 days. The subjects were then exposed to an impulse noise at 150 dB SPL. The temporal spacing of the impulses consisted of a series of 50 pairs of impulses presented 50 ms apart with 1000 ms between the onset of each pair. The total duration of exposure was approximately 1 min. Control animals received only the impulse noise exposure. PTS was measured after 4 weeks. The threshold shift (TS) patterns during the 'conditioning' phase were consistent with previous research, with the greatest amount of TS occurring on the second day and decreasing with continued exposures. Four weeks after recovery from the impulse noise, the experimental animals showed significantly less PTS than the control animals.

Other than gallstones, little is known about the risk factors for biliary tract cancers. Endogenous estrogens are thought to play a role in the etiology of gallstones and gallbladder cancer, since both conditions predominate in females and are associated with parity and obesity. In view of reports linking the CYP17 MspA1 polymorphism to high circulating levels of estrogens and a predisposition to other hormonally related cancers, we examined the relationship between CYP17 MspA1 variants and risk of biliary disease in a population-based case-control study in Shanghai. The study included 446 cancer cases (254 gallbladder, 139 extrahepatic bile duct, 53 ampullary cancers), 929 biliary stone cases (691 gallbladder, 238 bile duct) and 818 population controls. Genomic DNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes was used for genotyping. Relative to those with the A2/A2 genotype, A1 carriers (A1/A1 and A1/A2 genotypes) had an increased risk of gallbladder cancer (odds ratio (OR) = 1.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.1-2.1). In addition, women with the A1 allele and high parity (> or =3) had a 3-fold risk of gallbladder cancer (OR = 3.3, 95% CI = 1.6-6.9), compared to those with the A2/A2 genotype and lower parity, with the highest risk seen for those also having biliary stones (OR = 4.6, 95% CI = 1.8-11.7, P(interaction) = 0.04). The A1 allele was not associated with a higher risk of gallstones except among those with body mass index (BMI) greater than 25 kg/m2 (OR = 3.1, 95% CI = 2.0-4.8, P(interaction) = 0.02) and among those with a history of diabetes (OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.4-4.3, P interaction = 0.09). No clear relation was seen between the CYP17 polymorphism and cancers of the bile duct or ampulla of Vater.

As for the case of ClC-0, the probabilities and dwell times of the closed and conducting states are consistent with the presence of two independently gated pathways with approximately 1.2 pS conductance enabled in parallel via a common gate. However, the voltage dependence of the common gate is different and the kinetics are much faster than for ClC-0. Estimates of single-channel parameters from the analysis of macroscopic current fluctuations agree with those from single-channel recordings. Fluctuation analysis was used to characterize changes in the apparent double-gate behavior of the ClC-1 mutations I290M and I556N causing, respectively, a dominant and a recessive form of myotonia. We find that both mutations reduce about equally the open probability of single protopores and that mutation I290M yields a stronger reduction of the common gate open probability than mutation I556N. Our results suggest that the mammalian ClC-homologues have the same structure and mechanism proposed for the Torpedo channel ClC-0.

Tumor cells were injected in unanesthetized animals through an indwelling catheter inserted at the cisterna magna to the level of the lumbar enlargement of the spinal cord. Survival of rats was dependent on the number of tumor cells injected. Spread of tumor was quantified by histology using a grading scale, and functional and behavioral changes were measured. Rats injected with 10(6) 9L gliosarcoma cells showed progressive weight loss, flaccid paralysis, and neurogenic bladder dysfunction and had a median survival of 11 days. The tumor frequently grew as a mass compressing the spinal cord. The 9L gliosarcoma tumor cells markedly invaded the Virchow-Robin spaces but exhibited only minimal invasion of the central nervous system parenchyma. The tumor reached the brain by day 10. Rats injected with 2 X 10(5) Walker 256 carcinosarcoma cells showed progressive weight loss and weakness and had a median survival of 6 days. The tumor grew within the leptomeninges in a discontinuous multifocal fashion and reached the brain by day 4. There was extensive invasion of the central nervous system parenchyma by Walker 256 tumor cells along the Virchow-Robin spaces resulting in hemorrhage and necrosis of grey and white matter. Hot plate and tail flick response times were significantly delayed only in the days immediately preceding death of animals with either 9L or Walker 256 tumor and were not good indicators of tumor progression. Loss of motor coordination and failure of the stepping and placing reflex on the other hand showed good correlation with spread of tumor measured histologically.

Only cigarette smoking was more frequent in men (84 vs 11%, p less than 0.001), being the remaining coronary risk factors more common in women (hypertension 69% vs 37%, p less than 0.001; hypercholesterolemia 46% vs 33%, p less than 0.05, and diabetes mellitus 42% vs 14%, p less than 0.01). In addition, unstable angina was a more frequent indication of coronary angioplasty in women than in men (74% vs 61%, p less than 0.05), whereas coronary angioplasty after intravenous thrombolysis was more frequent in men (12% vs 1%, p less than 0.001). Coronary angioplasty angiographic success (87% vs 91%), and minor (16% vs 10%) or major (5% vs 3%) complications were not statistically different in the two groups. Nevertheless, success of the procedure in the absence of any complication was achieved in a higher percentage (86% vs 76%, p less than 0.05) of men than in their female counterparts. After coronary angioplasty 88% of women had an angiographic follow-up available which yielded a restenosis rate of 41% (vs 32% in men, NS), despite the absence of symptoms in the 89% of these patients in their last visit.

Based on the size and methylation status of the expansion, individuals are classified as having normal, intermediate, premutation or full mutation alleles. Unlike individuals with full mutations, carriers of intermediate and premutated alleles should not exhibit obvious clinical symptoms, since the FMR1 (FRAXA) or FMR2 (FRAXE) genes are not transcriptionally silenced. However, there are data suggesting a phenotype consequence of the FRAXA premutation alleles. We have investigated a population consisted of 276 males with idiopathic mental retardation or learning disability and a control sample of 207 non-affected boys in order to determine if there was a possible phenotype consequence of the expanded unmethylated alleles for FRAXA/FRAXE loci. Direct molecular diagnosis for the FRAXA/FRAXE loci were performed in both populations by using PCR technique and sizing of the amplification products by electrophoresis in denaturing polyacrilamide gels. No FRAXA/FRAXE premutations or FRAXE mutated alleles were observed. The 25 FRAXA full mutations alleles detected were confirmed by Southern blot analysis. We found an excess of intermediate alleles for both FRAXA and FRAXE in the target population, but it did not reach statistically significant difference. This suggests that relatively large unmethylated repeats may not be associated with an abnormal cognitive and/or behavioral phenotype. However, recent evidence that FRAXA premutation alleles in males have increased FMR1 message levels emphasizes the need of more studies using large sample sizes and proper control population to resolve this contradictory observation.",2003-Sep,"Adolescent;Brazil;Child;Child, Preschool;DNA Methylation;Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein;Fragile X Syndrome/genetics*:psychology;Humans;Intellectual Disability/genetics*;Male;Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics*:physiology;Nuclear Proteins/genetics*:physiology;RNA-Binding Proteins*;Trans-Activators/genetics*:physiology;Trinucleotide Repeat Expansion/physiology","Journal Article,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",International journal of molecular medicine,"AFF2 protein, human,FMR1 protein, human,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Nuclear Proteins,RNA-Binding Proteins,Trans-Activators,Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein"

In these rats, not only PTHrP but also several other human proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, leukemia-inducing factor, IL-8, IL-5 and IL-11, were secreted to the bloodstream. Proinflammatory cytokines induce acute-phase reactions, as evidenced by a decrease of serum albumin and an increase in alpha1-acid glycoprotein. Tumor resection abolished the production of proinflammatory cytokines and improved acute-phase reactions, whereas anti-PTHrP antibody affected neither proinflammatory cytokine production nor acute-phase reactions. Nevertheless, tumor resection and administration of anti-PTHrP antibody similarly and markedly attenuated not only hypercalcemia but also loss of fat, muscle and body weight. Body weight gain by anti-PTHrP antibody was associated with increased food consumption; increased body weight from anti-PTHrP antibody was observed when animals were freely fed but not when they were given the same feeding as those that received only vehicle. Furthermore, nude rats bearing LC-6-JCK showed reduced locomotor activity, less eating and drinking and low blood phosphorus; and anti-PTHrP antibody restored them. Although alendronate, a bisphosphonate drug, decreased blood calcium, it affected neither locomotor activity nor serum phosphorus level. These results indicate that PTHrP represses physical activity and energy metabolism independently of hypercalcemia and proinflammatory cytokine actions and that deregulation of such physiologic activities and functions by PTHrP is at least in part involved in PTHrP-induced wasting syndrome.",2005-Sep-1,"Adenocarcinoma/pathology*:veterinary;Animals;Body Weight;Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/pathology*:veterinary;Cytokines/blood:secretion;Disease Models, Animal;Energy Metabolism*;Feeding Behavior;Humans;Hypercalcemia/complications:physiopathology:veterinary;Kidney Neoplasms/pathology*:veterinary;Laryngeal Neoplasms/pathology*:veterinary;Lung Neoplasms/pathology*:veterinary;Motor Activity*;Pancreatic Neoplasms/pathology*:veterinary;Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein/physiology*;Rats;Rats, Nude;Transplantation, Heterologous;Wasting Syndrome/physiopathology*:veterinary",Journal Article,International journal of cancer.

We have, however, recently shown that hyperinsulinaemia is present only in the obese subjects with PCO in whom insulin concentrations correlate with those of luteinizing hormone. We therefore studied 24-hour blood profiles of growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) in obese and non-obese women with PCO, for comparison with their levels of insulin, C-peptide and other hormones, such as androgens which are known to be disturbed in PCO. Mean 24-hour GH levels were higher overall in PCO than in control subjects, although the difference was not significant. When, however, a separate analysis was made in obese as compared with non-obese PCO patients, GH concentrations were significantly higher in the non-obese group than in the obese (p = 0.0005). There was a significant negative correlation between body mass index and mean 24-hour GH concentrations (r = -0.641; p = 0.0006).

The proximal and distal inversion breakpoint was found to reside between markers D3S3692/D3S1553 and D3S3590/D3S2305, respectively. ATP13A4, a novel gene coding for a cation-transporting P-type ATPase, was found to be disrupted by the distal breakpoint. The ATP13A4 gene was shown to comprise a 3591-bp transcript encompassing 30 exons spanning 152 kb of the genomic DNA. This study discusses the characterization of ATP13A4 and its possible involvement in speech-language disorder.",2005-Aug,"Adenosine Triphosphatases/chemistry:genetics*:physiology;Amino Acid Sequence;Animals;Biological Transport;Blotting, Northern;Cations;Child;Chromosome Inversion*;Chromosomes, Artificial, Bacterial;Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3*;Cloning, Molecular;DNA/metabolism;DNA Mutational Analysis;Female;Humans;In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence;Language Disorders/genetics*;Models, Genetic;Molecular Sequence Data;Phosphorylation;Phylogeny;RNA, Messenger/metabolism;Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction;Risk Factors;Sequence Homology, Amino Acid;Tissue Distribution","Case Reports,Journal Article,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Genomics,"Cations,RNA, Messenger,DNA,Adenosine Triphosphatases,ATP13A4 protein, human"

165,166.0,14500776.0,Fetal Hypoxia,Fetal Hypoxia,None,0,0,Adenosine mediates decreased cerebral metabolic rate and increased cerebral blood flow during acute moderate hypoxia in the near-term fetal sheep.,"Exposure of the fetal sheep to moderate to severe hypoxic stress results in both increased cortical blood flow and decreased metabolic rate. Using intravenous infusion of 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX), a selective adenosine A1 receptor antagonist that is permeable to the blood brain barrier, we examine the role of adenosine A1 receptors in mediating cortical blood flow and metabolic responses to moderate hypoxia. The effects of DPCPX blockade are compared to controls as well as animals receiving intravenous 8-(p-sulfophenyl)-theophylline) (8-SPT), a non-selective adenosine receptor antagonist which has been found to be blood brain barrier impermeable. Laser Doppler flow probes, tissue PO2, and thermocouples were implanted in the cerebral cortices of near-term fetal sheep. Catheters were placed in the brachial artery and sagittal sinus vein for collection of samples for blood gas analysis. Three to seven days later responses to a 30-min period of fetal hypoxemia (arterial PO2 10-12 mmHg) were studied with administration of 8-SPT, DPCPX, or vehicle. Cerebral metabolic rate was determined by calculation of both brain heat production and oxygen consumption. In response to hypoxia, control experiments demonstrated a 42 +/- 7 % decrease in cortical heat production and a 35 +/- 10 % reduction in oxygen consumption. In contrast, DPCPX infusion during hypoxia resulted in no significant change in brain heat production or oxygen consumption, suggesting the adenosine A1 receptor is involved in lowering metabolic rate during hypoxia. The decrease in cerebral metabolic rate was not altered by 8-SPT infusion, suggesting that the response is not mediated by adenosine receptors located outside the blood brain barrier. In response to hypoxia, control experiments demonstrated a 35 +/- 7 % increase in cortical blood flow. DPCPX infusion did not change this increase in cortical blood flow, however 8-SPT infusion attenuated increases in flow, indicating that hypoxic increases in cerebral blood flow are mediated by adenosine but not via the A1 receptor. In summary, adenosine appears to play a key role in fetal hypoxic defences, acting to increase O2 delivery via adenosine A2 receptors and to decrease metabolic rate via A1 receptors inside the blood brain barrier. These data show for the first time in the mammalian fetus that the adenosine A1 receptor is an important mediator of brain metabolic rate during moderate hypoxia.",2003-Dec-15,"Adenosine/pharmacology*;Animals;Blood Flow Velocity/drug effects:physiology;Blood Gas Analysis;Blood Glucose/metabolism;Brain/blood supply:drug effects:embryology:metabolism*;Cerebrovascular Circulation/drug effects:physiology*;Energy Metabolism/drug effects;Fetal Hypoxia/physiopathology*;Gestational Age;Hemoglobins/metabolism;Infusions, Intravenous;Lactic Acid/blood;Oxyhemoglobins/metabolism;Purinergic P1 Receptor Antagonists;Sheep;Theophylline/analogs & derivatives*:pharmacology;Xanthines/administration & dosage:pharmacology","Journal Article,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",The Journal of physiology,"Blood Glucose,Hemoglobins,Oxyhemoglobins,Purinergic P1 Receptor Antagonists,Xanthines,1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine,Lactic Acid,Theophylline,Adenosine,8-(4-sulfophenyl)theophylline"

Procaine and DPH also increased the rate of seizure development (kindling) produced by repeated stimulation of the amygdala. Procaine and to a limited extentDPH would themselves act as convulsants in well kindled subjects. Diazepam, on the other hand, retarded or blocked amygdaloid kindling.

Also, none of these drugs had any effect on recruiting or post-tetanic potentiation (PTP) in secondary sites produced by amygdala stimulation and none of the drugs had any effect on amygdaloid AD thresholds. The effects of these drugs on the responses evoked by anterior neocortex stimulation were quite different. Diazepam had no effect on any of the characteristics of the discharge or convulsion even at twice the dose levels used for the amygdala group.

Plasma insulin, glucose and urea decreased, and liver glycogen increased with Merlin-2 treatment. Plasma ACTH and corticosterone increased to a maximum at the end of the experiment. The expression of the ob gene in adipose tissue was unchanged, and plasma leptin levels were also unchanged by treatment. Estrone levels increased more than 1500-fold, and estrone oleate rose 100-fold during treatment. The fact that estrone oleate had no effect on the leptin levels or expression in obese rats, in contrast with the marked inhibition observed in the lean suggests that the functionality of the leptin receptor is essential for estrone oleate inhibition of the ob gene. This also suggests that leptin may control ob gene expression in white adipose tissue and that estrone oleate may activate this process. The slimming effect of estrone oleate is, thus, not directly dependent on leptin, since both normoleptinemic and hyperleptinemic animals lose fat following treatment nor are the effects on appetite and energy expenditure mediated by leptin. However, leptin levels and the expression of the ob gene are directly linked with estrone oleate function. A possible involvement of leptin in estrone oleate action is postulated.

AD patients diverged in performance from controls, however, when repeating pseudowords composed of phonologically unusual forms. These results support two conclusions: (1) Aspects of phonological processing may become disrupted in AD patients in association with increasing dementia severity, while orthographic processing remains comparatively less impaired.

The diagnosis of coronary artery disease is often difficult to relieve on history and physical examination, so many sophisticated tests have been developed to allow an early and more accurate diagnosis. Physicians must decide the appropriate indications and strategies to correctly utilize different non-invasive diagnostic tests, in order to minimize the risks and maintain the cost effectiveness of their decisions. The Bayes' theorem can be utilized to calculate the probability of coronary artery disease starting from clinical data and multiple non-invasive tests results. This is a mathematical method by which the results of the different tests can be integrated into a quantitative statement of the post-test probability of coronary artery disease to reach a more accurate final prediction of the chance of disease. The prevalence of the pre-test probability of disease can be determined in every patient from informations readily obtained by clinical evaluation, in accordance with the data of the Framingham and other studies. The post-test likelihood of disease depends on the sensitivity and specificity of the test: this estimate, before any test is performed, is crucial both for further decisions on the need for other tests and for determining the final likelihood of coronary artery disease.",1996-Nov,Bayes Theorem;Chest Pain/diagnosis*;Dobutamine/diagnostic use*;Exercise Test*;Humans;Myocardial Ischemia/diagnosis*:ultrasonography,"English Abstract,Journal Article,Review",Recenti progressi in medicina,Dobutamine

Adult rabbits were fed on either a low-fat control diet (LF) or a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet (HF). Rabbits received a test meal containing [3H]cholesterol and [14C]triolein on days 0 and 63 for the LF group and days 14, 28, 42, 63 and 84 for the HF group. Blood was collected 24 h post-absorptively and 10, 24, 34 and 48 h after test-meal intake. Post-absorptive as well as postprandial lipoproteins and lipaemia were not modified in the LF rabbits, who did not show any atheroma deposition on day 119. In HF rabbits, postprandial plasma triacylglycerols peaked 24-34 h after meal intake. The 0-48 h areas under the curves of triacylglycerol and triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins (TRL) steadily increased with time of chronic lipid feeding with values significantly higher than those in the LF rabbits. The postprandial plasma and TRL concentrations of dietary radiolabelled lipids were significantly higher in HF than LF rabbits. Post-heparin lipoprotein lipase (EC 3.1.1.34) and hepatic lipase (EC 3.1.1.3) activities were twofold higher in HF rabbits than in LF rabbits at day 105. In HF rabbits, a marked atheroma plaque deposition in the aorta was observed (30.9 (SE 3.9) % of total surface). The extent of atheroma deposition was positively correlated to the postprandial responses of plasma total triacylglycerols and dietary-derived lipids as well as total cholesterol and dietary-derived cholesterol in HF rabbits.

At rest there were no akinetic segments in 28 patients, and at least one akinetic segment was found in 15 patients. Shifts in the diastolic P-V relationship with exercise were quantitated from the constants a and b of the linear log P-V relationship. In the control group a and b did not change significantly, but in all CAD groups a significant decrease in a and a significant increase in b were observed during exercise. While no patient with angina had an unchanged diastolic P-V relationship, as many as 12 patients had significant P-V shifts in the absence of angina.

Similar changes have been noted in growth-retarded, nonanemic fetuses, and we therefore hypothesized that isoimmunized fetuses requiring intrauterine transfusions might have diminished growth. We longitudinally studied growth patterns in 17 isoimmunized fetuses by noting biparietal diameter and head and abdominal circumference measurements at each transfusion. The distributions of these measurements above and below the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles derived from our general obstetric population were compared at the initial transfusion and the last ultrasonogram performed before delivery. Birth weights also were noted and their distribution around the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles was compared to the expected distribution. For each ultrasonographic parameter, the distribution of measurements at the last ultrasonogram before delivery was not significantly different from the distribution at the initial ultrasonogram. The birth weight distribution also was not significantly different than the expected distribution.

204,205.0,9489617.0,Pleurisy,Edema,None,0,0,Characterization of the receptor and the mechanisms underlying the inflammatory response induced by des-Arg9-BK in mouse pleurisy.,"1 The characterization of the B1 kinin receptor, and some mediators involved in the inflammatory response elicited by intrathoracic (i.t.) administration of des-Arg9-bradykinin (BK) in the mouse model of pleurisy, was investigated. 2 An i.t. injection of des-Arg9-BK (10-100 nmol per site), a selective B1 agonist, caused a significant and dose-related increase in the vascular permeability observed after 5 min, which peaked at 1 h, associated with an increase in cell influx, mainly neutrophils, and, to a lesser extent, mononuclear cell influx, peaking at 4 h and lasting for up to 48 h. The increase in fluid leakage caused by des-Arg9-BK was completely resolved 4 h after peptide injection. I.t. injection of Lys-des-Arg9-BK (30 nmol per site) caused a similar inflammatory response. 3 Both the exudation and the neutrophil influx elicited by i.t. injection of des-Arg9-BK were significantly antagonized (P<0.01) by an i.t. injection of the selective B1 antagonists des-Arg9-[Leu8]-BK (60 and 100 nmol per site) or des-Arg9-NPC 17731 (5 nmol per site), administered in association with des-Arg9-BK (P<0.01), or 30 and 60 min before the cellular peak, respectively. In contrast, an i.t. injection of the B2 bradykinin selective receptor antagonist Hoe 140 (30 nmol per site), at a dose which consistently antagonized bradykinin (10 nmol per site)-induced pleurisy, had no significant effect on des-Arg9-BK-induced pleurisy. 4 An i.t. injection of the selective tachykinin receptor antagonists (NK1) FK 888 (1 nmol per site), (NK2) SR 48968 (20 nmol per site) or (NK3) SR 142801 (10 nmol per site), administered 5 min before pleurisy induction, significantly antagonized neutrophil migration caused by i.t. injection of des-Arg9-BK. In addition, FK 888 and SR 142801, but not SR 48968, also prevented the influx of mononuclear cells in response to i.t. injection of des-Arg9-BK (P<0.01). However, the NK3 receptor antagonist SR 142801 (10 nmol per site) also significantly inhibited des-Arg9-BK-induced plasma extravasation. An i.t. injection of the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist CGRP8-37 (1 nmol per site), administered 5 min before pleurisy induction, inhibited des-Arg9-BK-induced plasma extravasation (P<0.01), without significantly affecting the total and differential cell migration. 5 The nitric oxide synthase inhibitors L-NOARG and L-NAME (1 pmol per site), administered 30 min beforehand, almost completely prevented des-Arg9-BK (i.t.)-induced neutrophil cell migration (P<0.01), and, to a lesser extent, mononuclear cell migration (P<0.01). The D-enantiomer D-NAME had no effect on des-Arg9-BK-induced pleurisy. At the same dose range, L-NOARG and L-NAME inhibited the total cell migration (P<0.01). L-NAME, but not L-NOARG caused significant inhibition of des-Arg9-BK-induced fluid leakage. Indomethacin (1 mg kg(-1), i.p.), administered 1 h before des-Arg9-BK (30 nmol per site), inhibited the mononuclear cell migration (P<0.05), but, surprisingly, increased the neutrophil migration at 4 h without interfering with plasma extravasation. The administration of terfenadine (50 mg kg(-1), i.p.), 30 min before des-Arg9-BK (30 nmol per site), did not interfere significantly with the total cell migration or with the plasma extravasation in the mouse pleurisy caused by i.t. injection of des-Arg9-BK. 6 Pretreatment of animals with the lipopolysaccharide of E. coli (LPS; 10 microg per animal, i.v.) for 24 h did not result in any significant change of the inflammatory response induced by i.t. injection of des-Arg9-BK compared with the saline treated group. However, the identical treatment of mice with LPS resulted in a marked enhancement of des-Arg9-BK induced paw oedema (P<0.01). 7 In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the inflammatory response induced by i.t. injection of desArg9-BK, in a murine model of pleurisy, is mediated by stimulation of constitutive B1 receptors. (These responses are largely mediated by release of neuropeptides such as substanceP or CGRP and also by NO, but products derived from cyclo-oxygenase pathway and histamine seem not to be involved. Therefore, these results further support the notion that the B1 kinin receptor has an important role in modulating inflammatory responses, and it is suggested that selective B1 antagonists may provide therapeutic benefit in the treatment of inflammatory and allergic conditions.",1998-Jan,"Animals;Bradykinin/analogs & derivatives*:toxicity;Capillary Permeability/drug effects;Cell Cycle;Disease Models, Animal;Edema/chemically induced;Inflammation/chemically induced:drug therapy;Kallidin/analogs & derivatives:pharmacology;Kinins/antagonists & inhibitors*;Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology;Male;Mice;Neuropeptides/physiology;Nitric Oxide/physiology;Pleura/cytology;Pleurisy/chemically induced*:drug therapy:pathology*;Receptors, Bradykinin/agonists:antagonists & inhibitors:physiology*;Receptors, Tachykinin/antagonists & inhibitors:physiology*","Journal Article,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",British journal of pharmacology,"Kinins,Lipopolysaccharides,Neuropeptides,Receptors, Bradykinin,Receptors, Tachykinin,Nitric Oxide,bradykinin, des-Arg(9)-,Kallidin,Bradykinin,kallidin, des-Arg(10)-"

Although there have been remarkable developments in obesity research over the past 10 years, the molecular mechanism of obesity is still not completely understood. Body weight results from the balance between food intake and energy expenditure. Recent studies have found that hypothalamic AMP-activated protein kinase plays a key role in regulating these processes. Leptin, insulin, glucose and alpha-lipoic acid have been shown to reduce food intake by lowering hypothalamic AMP-activated protein kinase activity, whereas ghrelin and glucose depletion increase food intake by increasing hypothalamic AMP-activated protein kinase activity. In addition, this enzyme plays a role in the central regulation of energy expenditure. These findings indicate that hypothalamic AMP-activated protein kinase is an important signal molecule, which integrates nutritional and hormonal signals and modulates feeding behavior and energy expenditure.",2005-Nov,AMP-Activated Protein Kinases;Adipose Tissue/metabolism;Body Weight*;Eating;Energy Metabolism;Homeostasis;Hypothalamus/metabolism*;Multienzyme Complexes/metabolism*;Obesity/genetics:metabolism*:physiopathology;Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism*;Signal Transduction/physiology,"Journal Article,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Review",The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,"Multienzyme Complexes,AMP-Activated Protein Kinases,Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases"

Sequential study of immune complex deposition, ultrastructural changes, proteinuria, and alterations in glomerular sialoprotein.","Experimental evidence suggests that barriers to glomerular filtration of macromolecules exist at the glomerular basement membrane itself and at the level of the epithelial cell and epithelial slit pores. The distribution of negatively charged glomerular sialoprotein (GSP) at the latter site and the reduction in histochemical staining for GSP reported in several clinical and experimental glomerular diseases suggest a role for this material in the regulation of glomerular permeability. Alternatively, reductions in GSP associated with proteinuria may reflect only epithelial cell swelling consequent to the proteinuria. The sequence of subepithelial immune complex deposition, epithelial cell swelling and foot process fusion, alterations in histochemical staining for GSP, and development of proteinuria was studied in 12 Lewis rats biopsied weekly during development of autologous immune complex (Heymann) nephropathy. Deposition of IgG was detectable 3 weeks after antigen injection by immunofluorescence. Electron-dense deposits were first seen by electron microscopy coincident with the appearance of complement at week 4. Proteinuria began at 6 to 8 weeks, 3 to 5 weeks after detectable immune complex deposition. Proteinuric animals had marked subepithelial immune complex deposition and extensive epithelial cell swelling and foot process fusion. Despite these changes, there was no detectable reduction in staining for GSP until week 14, 6 to 8 weeks after onset of proteinuria. Reductions in GSP apparently do not play a role in altering glomerular permeability early in autologous immune complex (Heymann) nephropathy, and proteinuria and epithelial cell swelling can be present in this model without detectable changes in GSP. These findings suggest that early alterations in GSP reported in some other proteinuric disorders may be of pathogenetic significance rather than simply a reflection of changes in epithelial cell morphology secondary to proteinuria.

Lesions were identified as glial tumors, hamartomas, or vascular malformations. Long-term outcome was assessed in terms of seizure frequency and certain psychosocial sequelae. Seizure onset occurred at an average age of 15 years (median = 13.5 years), and patients experienced seizures for an average of 13 years prior to surgery. The mean time of follow-up was 8.4 years post-surgery (median = 6 years). The Kaplan-Meier curve at median follow-up showed a seizure-free rate of 80%. Late seizure recurrence was documented for three patients; two had been seizure free for 10 years and one for 15 years after surgery before re-onset of seizures in the absence of tumor recurrence. A prolonged history of seizures prior to surgery was associated with a poorer seizure outcome (p = 0.06), suggesting that secondary epileptogenesis at sites distant to the lesion may develop with years of uncontrolled seizures.

223,224.0,8125860.0,Hyperventilation,Hyperventilation,None,0,0,Comparison of effects of exercise and hyperventilation on leukocyte kinetics in humans.,"The circulating leukocyte (WBC) count increases with exercise, because WBCs enter the circulation from the marginated pool. The lung is a major source of the demarginating cells, but it is unclear whether this occurs because of increased ventilatory movements, increased cardiac output, or both. The present study examined the mechanical effect of ventilation (VE) in six healthy men with three different protocols on three separate occasions. First, the subjects cycled for 5-min intervals at 50, 100, 150, and 200 W, and we measured heart rate (HR), minute ventilation (VE), tidal volume (VT), respiratory rate, and end-tidal CO2. Second, each subject reproduced his exercise VE by matching VT, respiratory rate, and end-tidal CO2 on a circuit designed for isocapnic hyperpnea (matched VE). The subjects then performed a hyperventilation (hyper-VE) protocol with a minimum VT of 1.5 liters and a respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min. Blood samples were drawn at rest and throughout each protocol for measurement of WBCs, hematocrit, and band cells. During cycling, VE increased (9 +/- 1 to 66 +/- 7 l/min), HR increased (71 +/- 7 to 172 +/- 10 beats/min), and WBCs increased (5.5 +/- 0.9 to 7.8 +/- 1.3 x 10(9)/l). During matched VE, VE increased (11 +/- 2 to 69 +/- 11 l/min), but neither HR nor WBCs increased (67 +/- 13 to 78 +/- 12 beats/min and 5.3 +/- 1.6 to 5.7 +/- 1.5 x 10(9)/l, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1993-Dec,Adult;Bicycling;Exercise/physiology*;Heart Rate/physiology;Humans;Hyperventilation/blood*;Kinetics;Leukocyte Count;Leukocytes/physiology*;Male;Respiratory Function Tests,"Comparative Study,Journal Article,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)",

Males and females responded to the prolactin as evidenced by increased milk secretion, adrenal hyperplasia and thymus gland involution. Although the prolactin- and reserpine-treated animals gained weight and manifested pituitary gland basophilia, the perphenazine-treated animals showed considerable loss of body weight as well as involution of the pituitary gland, ovaries and testes, suggesting a condition of induced hypopituitarism. Chronic treatment with prolactin, both directly and indirectly, caused uniform increases in serum enzymes, e.g., CPK, SGOT, SGPT and LDH, lipids, e.g., triglycerides, free fatty acids and cholesterol, glucose and BUN. Corticosterone production was enhanced by prolactin, reduced by perphenazine and unaffected by reserpine.

Twenty-two subjects with a mean age of 63.9 +/- 11.4 years met the criterion of having a CVA followed by a lower extremity amputation. Date and side of hemiparesis and amputation were noted and a relationship was determined using the two-tailed chi-square test. Twenty-one of 22 subjects had the amputation on the same side as their hemiparesis which represents a significant relationship (chi 2 = 18.16, p less than 0.001).

It is concluded there is a strong relationship between side of hemiparesis and subsequent lower extremity amputation with the amputation occurring most often on the hemiparetic side and earlier in patients with diabetes mellitus. The causal relationship between side of CVA and subsequent same sided amputation may be due to altered autonomic nervous system control, altered sensation with increased incidence of local unobserved trauma or decreased/altered muscle fiber use on the affected side.

The TIMP-3 null mouse is a model of MMP/TIMP imbalance, which develops air space enlargement and decreased lung function. These mice responded differently to cecal ligation and perforation (CLP)-induced septic lung injury than wild-type controls. The current study addresses whether the TIMP-3 knockout lung is susceptible to different types of insults or only those involving sepsis, by examining its response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis, mechanical ventilation (MV), and hyperoxia. TIMP-3 null noninjured controls of each insult consistently demonstrated significantly higher compliance vs. wild-type mice. Null mice treated with LPS had a further significantly increased compliance compared with untreated controls. Conversely, MV and hyperoxia did not alter compliance in the null lung. MMP abundance and activity increased in response to LPS but were generally unaltered following MV or hyperoxia, correlating with compliance alterations. All three insults produced inflammatory cytokines; however, the response of the null vs. wild-type lung was dependent on the type of insult. Overall, this study demonstrated that 1) LPS-induced sepsis produced a similar response in null mice to CLP-induced sepsis, 2) the null lung responded differently to various insults, and 3) the null susceptibility to compliance changes correlated with increased MMPs.

Their brains were dissected by hand into four parts (cerebellum, brain stem, hippocampus, cerebral cortex) and the labeling of lipid classes determined after extraction and separation. Although glycerol was incorporated into lipid better than ethanolamine in all areas, the fate of the injected radioactive precursors varied according both to area and treatment. The lowest uptake of radioactivity was in the cerebral cortex and the highest in the brain stem and hippocampus. Moreover, the administration of bicuculline influenced the distribution of radioactivity among lipid classes; these variations, however, were not dependent on the administered doses of bicuculline. We conclude that the effects on glycerolipid metabolism observed in convulsing animals are due to several causes including alterations of systemic parameters (hypertension, hypoxia, etc.).

At a large community hospital 107 stable patients who survived acute transmural myocardial infarction after thrombolytic therapy followed by an individual optimized medical treatment, were prospectively investigated by three noninvasive stress tests. All patients received bicycle ergometry, 99mTc perfusion scintigraphy and stress-echocardiography within three weeks after the acute event. Each patient underwent diagnostic cardiac catheterization for determination of angiographic data. 99mTc perfusion scintigraphy had the highest rate of positive test results (61%), as compared to bicycle ergometry (32%), stress echocardiography (34%) and stress induced angina in any of the stress tests performed (40%). In 79% of the patients studied, at least one of four ischemic parameters was positive. The combination of bicycle ergometry, stress induced angina and 99mTc perfusion scintigraphy detected myocardial ischemia in 78% of the patients studied. Concordance of at least three positive parameters was seen in only 27%. Intraindividual comparison between positive and negative test results was inconclusive.

In contrast to mixed breed (MB) canaries, cell division normally occurs in the auditory end organ of the BWS without any external manipulation. In addition, some of the cells in the auditory epithelium may be dying through an apoptotic-like process. In the present study two methods were used to quantify dying cells in the BWS and MB canary auditory epithelia: morphological criteria and TUNEL. Results confirm that some of the abnormal hair cells in the BWS auditory epithelium are apoptotic-like.

We assessed 92 patients (median gestational age at birth, 32 weeks (range, 24 to 36 weeks); median birth weight, 1840 gm (650 to 3500 gm)) who had had a single (n = 20) or recurrent ALTE. Median postnatal age at referral was 3.2 months (0.5 to 44.7 months). All had been considered otherwise free of symptoms and adequately oxygenated in air at the time of discharge from their neonatal unit, before the ALTE. Fifty-two patients had received mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, and 40 vigorous stimulation. Ninety-one patients underwent 8- to 12-hour recordings of arterial oxygen saturation, the plethysmographic waveforms from the oximeter, breathing movements, and electrocardiograms. These recordings were compared with previously published data from 110 ""healthy"" preterm infants made at around 6 weeks after discharge from hospital. Compared with these data, 49 recordings (54%) were normal, 19 showed abnormal hypoxemic episodes, 6 had abnormally low baseline arterial oxygen saturation (< 95%), and 17 had both. In 31 of 33 patients, ALTE stopped or were reduced in frequency or severity after additional inspired oxygen (0.1 to 1.0 L/min via nasal cannulas) was given. Oxygen was given for a median duration of 3.9 months (range, 0.8 to 17.2 months). Persistent events in the remaining two patients were subsequently found to be due to intentional suffocation in one and epileptic seizures in the other. Monitoring of transcutaneous oxygen tension at home was undertaken in 84 patients. To date, this has been discontinued in 81 after a median duration of 7.3 months (0.3 to 18.9 months).

Apropos of a personal case, review of the literature].","After describing a case of early hydrops fetalis in a fetus demonstrating supraventricular tachycardia (TSVF) the authors review the literature: First they note the increase in the number of cases of TSVF published in the last few years, thanks to better means of monitoring pregnancies and to the place taken by TSVF among the different other troubles of fetal heart rhythm than can occur. The second section enumerates and analyses the pathological associations and the complications that have been observed in cases of TSVF that have been indexed. All have a poor prognosis: as far as those cases where there are faults in the rhythm which are associated with or alternate with TSVF, congestive heart failure occurs in 50% of cases, and organic heart pathological conditions in 20% of cases. 19.1% die. The third section analyses the means available for diagnosis and prognosis and the value of these means. Diagnosis rests on screening by clinical observation (careful auscultation in every pregnancy, observation of the raised height of the uterine fundus and a lessening in active fetal movements) and by monitoring. Only the ECG can confirm the diagnosis. Congestive heart failure is diagnosed by using ultrasound. A cardiac malformation should be searched for thoroughly by ultrasound. Monitoring in labour has no use as a prognostic indicator. Only repeated measurements of pH can demonstrate fetal distress in labour. The last section is concerned with management: digitalisation is strongly to be recommended before the fetus is mature. Propranolol should be reserved for resistant and severe cases: when there is no congestive heart failure a wait and see policy under strict observation can be followed. If there is congestive heart failure, caesarean section must be carried out. After delivery resuscitation with vagal stimulation is often sufficient, but when it is not digitalisation can be used and very rarely electric cardioversion is needed.

The therapeutic effect of a monoclonal antibody against endogenous NGF was evaluated by intraperitoneal administration of a single preoperative dose of anti-NGF. Of three different doses of anti-NGF used, the highest dose 2.8 mg/kg anti-NGF attenuated or almost abolished guarding pain scores at 4-h, 1-day (>80% decrease) and 2-days after incision.

The problem of maintaining weight loss.,"The introduction of behavior modification in the treatment of obesity a decade ago resulted in a substantial increase in weight loss of persons treated for mild to moderate obesity. It has been hoped that this increased effectiveness of treatment would extend also to maintenance of weight loss, and the first controlled clinical trial suggested that it did. This article reports the results of (1) a five-year follow-up of this first trial and (2) all follow-up studies of behavior modification for obesity yet conducted, six published and four previously unpublished. A new method of data analysis shows that weight losses are only modestly maintained, although the question of how their maintenance compares with that of other treatments cannot be answered because comparable data on other treatments are not available. In contrast to the vast amount of work on the initiation and generalization of behavior change, study of its maintenance has been a neglected area of behavior modification.

After 4 weeks, the rats and food consumption were weighed and serum E2 and leptin levels were measured by radioimmunoassays. Furthermore, the expression levels of ob mRNA obtained from the bilateral perimetric fat pads were estimated by Northern blot analysis. The mean weight and food consumption in group 2 were significantly (p < 0.01) heavier than those in group 1. But there were no significant differences between group 1 and group 3. The expression levels of ob mRNA in group 2 were lower than those in group 1, however, the levels of group 3 were restored to the level of group 1.

At the end of the apnea there was marked hyperventilation (inspired minute ventilation rose 21.6 +/- 3.5 L on the first breath) followed by hypocapnia, hypopnea, and pauses in inspiratory effort as the subjects resumed NREM sleep. Hypocapnia was greater before inspiratory pauses lasting at least 5 sec than before shorter pauses (PETco2, 4.2 +/- 1.8 mm Hg below baseline vs 1.2 +/- 2.5 mm Hg below baseline). In three patients, pauses in inspiratory effort following experimental obstructive apnea were prevented by administration of 4 percent CO2 and 40 percent O2 inspired gas.

Sera from patients with rapidly progressive hearing loss have been shown to contain antibodies to a 68-kD protein in heterologous inner-ear tissue. Using guinea pig inner-ear tissue as the antigenic substrate and either Western blot or immunofluorescence (IF) or both, we tested sera from 74 patients suspected to have autoimmune hearing loss for inner-ear antibodies. Sera from 73 patients were tested by Western blot, and sera from 36 were tested by IF. Thirty-seven of 73 (51%) had antibody to a 68-70-kD protein by Western blot. Sera positive by IF stained supporting cells with a staining pattern like that previously observed with the KHRI-3 monoclonal antibody. There was concordance between Western blot and IF assays. Of 36 patients tested by both assays, 29/31 (94%) that were positive in Western blot were also positive by IF, three were negative by both tests, and two each were positive by one assay but negative by the other. Absorption of patient sera with human inner-ear tissue removed antibody reactivity to the guinea pig supporting cells, indicating that the antigen detected by the autoantibody is also present in the human inner ear. Absorption with an equal volume of white or red blood cells from the tissue donor did not remove the antibody reactivity to inner ear, showing that the absorption by inner-ear tissue is specific. Sera from three patients positive in both assays also stained a 68-70-kD inner-ear protein immunoprecipitated by the KHRI-3 monoclonal antibody, indicating that the monoclonal and human antibodies recognize the same antigen. The results support the hypothesis that patients with autoimmune sensorineural hearing loss produce autoantibodies to an inner-ear supporting cell antigen that is phylogenetically conserved and defined by the murine monoclonal antibody KHRI-3.

Review].,"An established fact in the polycystic ovarian syndrome (POS) is an abnormal ovarian steroidogenesis. Though this suggest an intrinsic ovarian defect, the syndrome could also be influenced by factors outside the ovaries. Although of unknown etiology, the POS is one of the most frequent endocrine disorders in the gynecologic practice. The disorder is characterized by ultrasound findings of enlarged polycystic ovaries, hyperandrogenism, menstrual disorders, obesity and including the appearance of infertility. There are a series of mechanisms involved in the extraovarian androgen increase in patients with POS. Among these mechanisms are implicated those of central and peripheral origin, genetic factors and adrenocortical dysfunction. In the same way, the alterations produced could imply genetic, molecular biological, biochemical, physiological and endocrinological factors. Sometimes all these factors could interact at the same time. The high serum androgen level could stop the pituitary gonadotropin production, either as a direct mechanism or as a result of its peripheral conversion. The increased androgens also explain the manifestations of clinical acne, hirsutism, and the detention in follicular ovarian maturation. All these manifestations are related with the menstrual disorders, anovulation, and infertility that these patients develop. The characteristics of the extraovarian POS include the 17-hydroxyprogesterone elevation in response to the ACTH test and the dexamethasone suppression of adrenal androgens. It is possible to improve the ovarian function in some patients with POS. This could be achieved with clomiphene citrate associated with glucocorticoids to induce ovulation.",2001-Mar,"11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases;17-alpha-Hydroxyprogesterone/blood;3-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases/deficiency:genetics;Adrenal Cortex/metabolism;Adrenal Hyperplasia, Congenital/complications;Adrenocortical Hyperfunction/complications;Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/diagnostic use;Adult;Androgens/metabolism;Catecholamines/physiology;Clomiphene/therapeutic use;Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone/physiology;Cortisone/therapeutic use;Dexamethasone/diagnostic use:therapeutic use;Female;Glucocorticoids/metabolism;Gonadal Steroid Hormones/metabolism;Humans;Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases/deficiency:genetics;Hyperinsulinism/complications;Hyperprolactinemia/complications;Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/physiopathology;Infant, Newborn;Infertility, Female/drug therapy:etiology;Insulin Resistance;Leptin/blood;Mineralocorticoids/metabolism;Obesity/complications;Ovary/metabolism;Ovulation Induction;Pituitary-Adrenal System/physiopathology;Polycystic Ovary Syndrome/etiology*:genetics:metabolism;Pseudopregnancy/etiology;Steroid 11-beta-Hydroxylase/genetics;Steroid 17-alpha-Hydroxylase/genetics;Steroids/metabolism*;Sterol Esterase/deficiency:genetics;Stress, Psychological/complications:metabolism","English Abstract,Journal Article,Review",Investigaci¨®n cl¨ªnica,"Androgens,Catecholamines,Glucocorticoids,Gonadal Steroid Hormones,Leptin,Mineralocorticoids,Steroids,Dexamethasone,Cortisone,17-alpha-Hydroxyprogesterone,Adrenocorticotropic Hormone,Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone,Clomiphene,3-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases,Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases,11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases,Steroid 11-beta-Hydroxylase,Steroid 17-alpha-Hydroxylase,Sterol Esterase"

Data were compared with results from nonobese controls. In obese patients the most marked differences were reduced relative contents of linoleic acid in serum triglycerides (P less than 0.001), cholesterol esters (P less than 0.05) and phospholipids (P less than 0.001). Linolenic acid was reduced in serum triglycerides (P less than 0.001) and in cholesterol esters (P less than 0.01). There were reciprocal increases in palmitic and palmitoleic acid (P less than 0.05) in these two serum lipid fractions. In adipose tissue of obese patients only minor differences were found in palmitoleic acid, which was increased, and in the saturated fatty acids with 14, 16 and 18 carbon atoms which were decreased. Weight loss (600 kcal/day for 6 weeks, P/S ratio about 0.5) did not affect adipose tissue fatty acid composition, but resulted in reductions of linoleic acid content in cholesterol esters and phospholipids, with reciprocal increases of palmitic and arachidonic acid in these fractions.

Three months after the diet switch the relative decrease in body weight was more marked among hypertensive women (5%) than in female normotensives (3%), but similar among men of both groups (5%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1992-Sep,"Adult;Blood Pressure/physiology;Body Weight/physiology*;Dairy Products*;Diet, Vegetarian*;Female;Humans;Hypertension/diet therapy*;Male;Middle Aged;Trace Elements/analysis","Journal Article,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",European journal of clinical nutrition,Trace Elements

A total of 47 speakers (10 young normal, 10 old normal, 13 nonaphasic right-brain-damaged patients, 14 left-brain-damaged aphasic patients, 9 fluent, 5 nonfluent) produced all 25 possible sequences of two tones from the five lexical tones of Thai embedded in a carrier sentence. F0 contours were analyzed in terms of height and slope at 10% intervals throughout the duration of the two syllables. Acoustic analysis revealed that anticipatory and perseverative tonal coarticulation of tones was markedly reduced in left fluent aphasics, totally absent in left nonfluent aphasics, but reasonably intact in right hemisphere patients.

Recent studies have reported a better than expected outcome in some patients; however, the conclusions of these studies have been confounded to some extent by their inclusion criteria. We report follow-up of 17 patients with CHARGE association in whom the diagnosis was based on clinical findings present in early infancy, before developmental patterns were established. Of the 7 survivors, all had motor delay, and 6 had feeding difficulties during infancy. Psychometric assessment at follow-up (age range 2 years, 10 months, to 15 years) showed that 2 were functioning in the normal range, 3 had specific language delay, one had moderate mental retardation, and one had severe mental retardation. Feeding problems persisted in only the 2 youngest patients. After initial failure to thrive, normal height was reached in 4 of 5 children older than age 3 years. The effects of visual and hearing deficits, their management, and the effects of physical illness are discussed with respect to developmental outcome. Our results suggest that some infants with CHARGE association who survive early infancy have a better prognosis for feeding difficulties, growth, and mental development than may be expected from early performance and better than that generally predicted from the current literature.

We report a rare case of CPC caused by GER, in which treatment with an H2-blocker or with a proton pump inhibitor was successful. A 65-year-old woman had complained of coughing for over 25 years. Her coughing was not alleviated by treatment with a bronchodilator (beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist), an anti-allergic agent, a corticosteroid, or a sedative. GER was considered as a possible cause of her coughing because exacerbation of the coughing was associated with the development of gastrointestinal symptoms (heartburn). Fiberoptic esophagoscopy showed esophagitis and esophageal herniation of the sliding type. Twenty four-hour monitoring of distal esophageal pH showed that the coughing occurred when the pH dropped below 4, and that the pH was less than 4 for about 7% of the whole monitoring time. An H2-blocker or a proton pump inhibitor completely eliminated the symptoms. Therefore, CPC caused by GER was diagnosed. We found that coughing could be induced by instillation of 0.1 N hydrochloric acid at the distal esophagus, and that the coughing was partially inhibited by inhalation of an anti-muscarinic agent (ipratropium bromide) and by esophageal instillation of 4% xylocaine. These data support the ""reflex theory"". Although CPC caused by GER is rare in Japan, we should remember that GER can be a cause of CPC even in Japanese patients.",1995-Jun,Aged;Chronic Disease;Cimetidine/therapeutic use;Cough/drug therapy:etiology*;Female;Gastroesophageal Reflux/complications*:drug therapy;Histamine H2 Antagonists/therapeutic use;Humans;Omeprazole/therapeutic use;Proton Pumps/antagonists & inhibitors,"Case Reports,English Abstract,Journal Article","Nihon Kyōbu Shikkan Gakkai zasshi ","Histamine H2 Antagonists,Proton Pumps,Cimetidine,Omeprazole"

The main reasons for diversion were incontinence in 17 patients and failed ureteral reimplants in 3, and those for undiversion were a desire for an improved quality of life in 16, increasing hydronephrosis in 4 and stomal problems in 3. Preoperative assessment included upper and lower tract imaging, and video urodynamics. Operations on the ureters included reimplantation into an intussuscepted nipple valve in 8 patients, tunneled reimplants into a sigmoid augmentation in 3 and the ureters joined to either the bladder or lower ureter without interposing bowel in 9. All reimplantations were done with nonrefluxing techniques. A total of 18 patients underwent bladder augmentation and 2 women in whom cystectomy was performed for pyocystis underwent substitutions. Simultaneous continence procedures in 18 patients included trigonal tubularization in 2, artificial sphincter implantation in 2, a bladder neck sling in 5 or bladder neck tapering and a sling in 9. The patients were followed for a mean of 69 months (range 21 to 133). Eight patients required reintervention within 1 year for problems, such as anastomotic leak in 1, bladder neck obstruction in 1, incontinence in 1, artificial urinary sphincter revisions in 1 and bladder stones in 1. One patient had a recurrent renal calculus 10 years after undiversion. All patients experienced either persistence of normal upper tract appearance or improvement and/or stabilization of hydronephrosis. Mean bladder capacity was 77 cc preoperatively and 480 cc postoperatively, while mean pressure at capacity decreased from 50 to 14 cm. water with detubularized augmentation. Of the patients 17 are completely dry, 2 wear 1 pad per day and 1 has enuresis. All but 1 patient who voids with straining are on intermittent self-catheterization. All patients, on followup interviews, reported an improved quality of life without a stoma. We conclude that undiversion provides an improved quality of life and an acceptable morbidity rate. The choice of operation depends on the anatomy of the patient. We prefer a nonprosthetic type of incontinence procedure when intermittent self-catheterization is to be done.

Fractures of the thoracolumbar spine are relatively common, so clinicians must give them every consideration both to protect from secondary spinal cord injury and to appreciate the extent of the patient's injuries. Other extraspinal as well as noncontiguous injuries to the spinal column are frequently present. Unfortunately, thoracolumbar spine fractures are often missed or diagnosed late in clinical series. In an era of cost-containment, not all responsive patients require full thoracolumbar spine radiographs. In awake, alert, nonintoxicated patients with simple injury mechanisms, these fractures can be ruled out through physical examination, if the patient has no physical findings and does not have other serious injuries. However, concern has recently been raised that some patients may have ""asymptomatic"" fractures that may be missed without radiography. The evidence reveals that fractures are not truly asymptomatic but may be masked by other distracting injuries, making them fractures occult rather than asymptomatic.

The MHCII knock-out shortened the kinetics of animal death and reduced the dose of S. typhimurium needed to kill mice. We measured the physiological and cytokine responses of both mouse strains after S. typhimurium injection. Animal weight loss, spleen weights, liver weights, thymus weights, and serum corticosterone concentrations were comparable after injection with several doses of bacteria. The only physiological differences observed between the two strains were observed 3 days after injection of the highest dose of bacteria tested. Serum concentrations of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-2, and interleukin-6 increased in a dose-dependent fashion irrespective of mouse MHCII expression. Therefore, even in the absence of MHCII, mice are able to mount relatively normal physiological and immunological responses. Consistent with these normal responses, an increased percentage of MHCII-/- mice, primed with a low dose of bacteria 13 days earlier, were able to survive a lethal challenge of Salmonella compared with unprimed controls. Lastly, C2D mice had significantly higher serum interleukin-10 concentrations than C57BL/6J mice 48 h after infection with all doses of S. typhimurium.

Effective pharmacological treatments are scarce, but one group of drugs that has shown promise is the antiepileptics. Gabapentin has become popular as a first-line treatment for neuropathic pain because of its efficacy as an antineuropathic agent and relatively benign side-effect profile. However, its mechanism of action is far from clear. This review discusses the available evidence for the postulated mechanisms of action of gabapentin.

Five males with tetraplegia (TP) and four males with paraplegia (PR) exercised 1) sitting, 2) supine, and 3) sitting with the addition of a) an anti-gravity suit (anti-G), b) elastic stockings and abdominal binder, and c) functional electrical stimulation of the leg muscles. Compared to sitting, the following significant changes were observed: in the supine position, heart rate (HR) decreased (PR: 104 vs 118 b/min, TP: 76 vs 92 b/min) and stroke volume (SV) increased (PR: 132 vs 116 ml, TP: 96 vs 83 ml). The anti-G suit induced a decrease in heart rate (PR: 104 vs 118 b/min, TP: 87 vs 92 b/min) and a decrease in oxygen uptake (VO2) in PR. Stockings only affected TP, i.e. a decrease in heart rate with 5 b/min and an increase in stroke volume with 13 ml/beat. Functional electrical stimulation produced an increase in VO2 (PR: 1.00 vs 0.95 l/min, TP: 0.68 vs 0.53 l/min) and a rise in stroke volume in TP.

The most detrimental health and longevity effects will not be seen for decades--a phenomenon that cannot be detected by current methods used to forecast life expectancy or estimate the number of deaths currently attributable to obesity. This scenario contrasts sharply with the views of mathematical demographers who generate forecasts by relying on the assumption that the U.S. pattern of longevity will follow that of other longer lived nations and on the extrapolation of historical trends in life expectancy into the future.,2005-Jun-1,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Child;Child Welfare;Child, Preschool;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2;Humans;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Life Expectancy*;Middle Aged;Mortality/trends*;Obesity/complications*;Risk Factors;United States/epidemiology","Comment,Journal Article",Science of aging knowledge environment : SAGE KE,

The program involved 5 adolescent stutterers who were receiving an intensive treatment incorporating a prolonged speech procedure. In Study A, a clinician used a 9-point rating scale to score the speech naturalness of 1-min speaking samples each stutterer made at intervals over the course of the program. The results demonstrated predictable trends in speech naturalness during the program, but they also showed that natural sounding speech is not a predictable outcome of a procedure that removes stuttering, controls speaking rate, and exposes clients to transfer procedures. In Study B, 3 of the 5 stutterers participated in single subject experiments partway through their therapy program. These experiments were designed to assess the effect of regular feedback of speech naturalness ratings on the stutterer's spontaneous speech. The results showed that each subject's speech naturalness ratings could be modified toward a target level of speech naturalness.",1985-Aug,Adolescent;Feedback;Female;Humans;Male;Speech/physiology*;Speech Therapy/methods;Stuttering/physiopathology:therapy*,Journal Article,The Journal of speech and hearing disorders,

Even though half of the world's cancer patients live in developing countries, < 10% of the resources committed to cancer control are available to them. Reports have shown that between 30-50% of cancer patient are either experiencing pain or being treated for it. The literature supports the idea that pain does not have the same debilitating effect in the Eastern cultures as it does in the Western cultures. Therefore, patients from both a Western and an Eastern culture were observed. This qualitative research, based on grounded theory, sampled 10 persons from India and 10 from the United States. Focused, open-ended interviews were used as the main manner of gathering data. There was a significant difference in the degree of pain experienced by each culture, which was related to available resources. The most significant finding was that the report of pain was not proportional to the quality of life and meaning found in this pain experience for each patient.

To evaluate underlying mechanisms, we developed a model of Taxol-induced painful peripheral neuropathy in the rat and determined the involvement of two second messengers that contribute to enhanced nociception in other models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain, protein kinase Cepsilon and protein kinase A. Taxol administered acutely, or chronically over 12 days, produced a decrease in mechanical nociceptive threshold. Acutely, Taxol induced hyperalgesia that was significant within 1 h, maximal after 6 h and resolved completely by 24 h after a single treatment. Chronically, Taxol treatment resulted in a dose (0.1-1 mg/kg/day)-dependent decrease in nociceptive threshold, measured 24 h after administration, maximal within 5 days from the commencement of Taxol administration and resolving by 2 weeks after the last dose of Taxol. Chronic Taxol treatment also increased the number of action potentials evoked by sustained (60-s) threshold and suprathreshold (10-g) stimulation of a sub-population of C-fibers in rats with Taxol-induced hyperalgesia. Mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia were also present in Taxol-treated rats. Hyperalgesia, produced by both acute and chronic Taxol, was attenuated by intradermal injection of selective second messenger antagonists for protein kinase Cepsilon and protein kinase A.

In the present study, we investigated the ethanolic extract of the aerial parts of Andrographis paniculata for antihyperglycaemic and anti-oxidant effects in normal and streptozotocin-induced type I diabetic rats. 2. Normal and diabetic rats were randomly divided into groups and treated orally by gavage with vehicle (distilled water), metformin (500 mg/kg bodyweight) or the extract (400 mg/kg bodyweight), twice a day for 14 days. 3. At the end of the 14 day period, the extract, like metformin, significantly increased bodyweight (P < 0.01) and reduced fasting serum glucose in diabetic rats (P < 0.001) when compared with vehicle, but had no effect on bodyweight and serum glucose in normal rats. Levels of liver and kidney thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) were significantly increased (P < 0.0001, P < 0.01, respectively), while liver glutathione (GSH) concentrations were significantly decreased (P < 0.005) in vehicle-treated diabetic rats. Liver and kidney TBARS levels were significantly lower (P < 0.0001, P < 0.005, respectively), whereas liver GSH concentrations were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in extract- and metformin-treated diabetic rats compared with vehicle-treated diabetic rats. Andrographis paniculata significantly decreased kidney TBARS level (P < 0.005) in normal rats. Hepatic superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities were significantly lower in vehicle-treated diabetic rats compared with vehicle-treated normal rats. The extract, as well as metformin, significantly increased the activity of SOD and CAT, but had no significant effect on GSH-Px activity in diabetic rats. The extract and metformin did not produce significant changes in the activity of these anti-oxidant enzymes in normal rats. 4.

The model treats the cortex as a medium for the propagation of waves of electrical activity, incorporating key physiological processes such as propagation delays, membrane physiology, and corticothalamic feedback. Previous analyses have demonstrated its descriptive validity in a wide range of healthy states and yielded specific predictions with regards to seizure phenomena. We show that mapping the structure of the nonlinear bifurcation set predicts a number of crucial dynamic processes, including the onset of periodic and chaotic dynamics as well as multistability. Quantitative study of electrophysiological data supports the validity of these predictions. Hence, we argue that the core electrophysiological and cognitive differences between tonic-clonic and absence seizures are predicted and interrelated by the global bifurcation diagram of the model's dynamics.

Intelligibility measures based on these tests may not adequately evaluate the perceptual processes used to perceive speech under more natural listening conditions involving many sources of stimulus variability. The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of stimulus variability and lexical difficulty on the speech-perception abilities of 17 adults with mild-to-moderate hearing loss. The effects of stimulus variability were studied by comparing word-identification performance in single-talker versus multiple-talker conditions and at different speaking rates. Lexical difficulty was assessed by comparing recognition of ""easy"" words (i.e., words that occur frequently and have few phonemically similar neighbors) with ""hard"" words (i.e., words that occur infrequently and have many similar neighbors). Subjects also completed a 20-item questionnaire to rate their speech understanding abilities in daily listening situations. Both sources of stimulus variability produced significant effects on speech intelligibility. Identification scores were poorer in the multiple-talker condition than in the single-talker condition, and word-recognition performance decreased as speaking rate increased. Lexical effects on speech intelligibility were also observed. Word-recognition performance was significantly higher for lexically easy words than lexically hard words. Finally, word-recognition performance was correlated with scores on the self-report questionnaire rating speech understanding under natural listening conditions. The pattern of results suggest that perceptually robust speech-discrimination tests are able to assess several underlying aspects of speech perception in the laboratory and clinic that appear to generalize to conditions encountered in natural listening situations where the listener is faced with many different sources of stimulus variability. That is, word-recognition performance measured under conditions where the talker varied from trial to trial was better correlated with self-reports of listening ability than was performance in a single-talker condition where variability was constrained.",1997-Dec,Adult;Aged;Female;Hearing Disorders/diagnosis*;Hearing Tests/methods;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Noise*;Semantics;Severity of Illness Index;Speech Perception*;Vocabulary,"Journal Article,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","Journal of speech, language, and hearing research : JSLHR",

These echoes were stronger and more numerous than normal. This association was not apparent with drug-induced cholestasis or acute viral hepatitis.

Cellular mechanisms for this feedback regulation were studied in neocortex pyramidal cells by injecting Homer-1a protein intracellularly. The injection reduced membrane excitability as demonstrated in two ways. First, the resting potential was hyperpolarized by 5-10 mV. Second, the mean frequency of spikes evoked by depolarizing current injection was decreased. This reduction of excitability was prevented by applying each of the followings: the calcium chelator BAPTA, the calcium store depletor cyclopiazonic acid (CPA), the insitol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP(3)R) blocker heparin, the phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U-73122, the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) antagonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP), and the large-conductance calcium activated potassium channel (BK channel) antagonist charybdotoxin. The small-conductance calcium activated potassium channel (SK channel) blocker dequalinium was ineffective. These findings suggest that activation of mGluR by Homer-1a produced IP(3), which caused inositol-induced calcium release and a consequent BK channel opening, thus hyperpolarizing the injected neurons. In slices from rats subjected to electroconvulsive shock (ECS), a comparable reduction of excitability was observed without Homer-1a injection. The ECS-induced reduction of excitability was abolished by MPEP, charybdotoxin, heparin or BAPTA. Intracellular injection of anti-Homer-1a antibody was suppressive as well, but anti-Homer-1b/c antibody was not.

In the tourists returning from the area hyperendemic for malaria, visceral leishmaniosis, amoebiasis and haemorrhagic fevers and not following tropical hygiene measures, persistent fever was a source of difficulties in differential diagnosis. In the first case, lack of anti-malarial chemoprophylaxis in the presence of anaemia and thrombocytopenia strongly suggested Plasmodium spp. infection. Two daily peaks of fever with splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, leucopenia, high transaminases levels and co-existing positive serology for L. donovani pointed to visceral leishmaniosis. Late occurrence of specific anti-S. typhi agglutinins in the Widal test, cross-reactivity with S. paratyphi A and negative urine bacteriological culture were observed. In the second case, gastrointestinal disturbances, including pain, abdominal tenderness and diarrhoea gave a suspicion of amoebic colitis.

The weight gain during pregnancy was proportional to the fetal weight index at birth (r = 0.72, P less than 0.0005). It is concluded that obese type 2 diabetic women are best treated by a low caloric diet and, when necessary, small doses of insulin.

The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of atorvastatin treatment on the fibrinolytic system in patients with dyslipidemia. The investigation was carried out on 41 dyslipidemic patients (21 males and 20 females) with a mean age of 53.8 years (range, 30-76). The patients were divided into subgroups according to their cholesterol and triglyceride levels as hypercholesterolemic (n = 26) and mixed-type hyperlipidemic (n = 15) and their risk factors for coronary heart disease including age, sex, hypertension, obesity, smoking, and family history. The patients were started on atorvastatin 10 mg/day, and evaluated within 6-12 weeks to assess the changes in fibrinolytic parameters including global fibrinolytic capacity, plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 and tissue plasminogen activator, and lipids. After successful lipid-lowering therapy, global fibrinolytic capacity (P = 0.003) and tissue plasminogen activator levels (P = 0.04) were found to be increased and plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 levels (P = 0.02) decreased in dyslipidemic patients. Global fibrinolytic capacity levels increased (P < 0.001) and plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 levels decreased (P = 0.01) in patients with hypercholesterolemia (n = 26). However, no significant changes were observed in fibrinolytic parameters in patients with mixed-type hyperlipidemia (n = 15). When the patients were separately evaluated according to risk factors, significant beneficial effects on the fibrinolytic system were observed, especially in patients without obesity and hypertension as well as in older patients and males. These findings suggest that atorvastatin treatment has a beneficial effect on the fibrinolytic system in patients with hypercholesterolemia, but not in patients with mixed-type hyperlipidemia.

The long-term effectiveness of available medical and nonablative surgical treatments has been variable, with frequent symptom recurrence. Vestibular neurectomy and labyrinthectomy, surgically ablative techniques, provide more permanent relief from vertiginous attacks. However, these procedures pose possible morbidity and cochlear risk. In this paper, preliminary results are presented for two patients who underwent intratympanic gentamicin application. Like surgical labyrinthectomy, intratympanic use of gentamicin is intended as an ablative procedure, but with potentially less risk to hearing. More vestibulotoxic than cochleotoxic, gentamicin initially disrupts the endolymph-secreting vestibular dark cells, thereby preventing endolymphatic hydrops development. Following gentamicin application, both patients demonstrated a significant change in peripheral vestibular function, as characterized by a reduction of caloric response, impaired posturography performance, and reduced low-frequency gain on rotary chair testing. Posturography performance subsequently improved, confirming functional compensation. Both patients reported relief from vertiginous attacks.

Amiloride at dosages as low as 1.0 microgram/g body weight per injection also inhibited tumor cell proliferation as measured by the tritated thymidine autoradiography labeling index. Amiloride caused no changes in the mean profile diameters of metaphase or interphase H6 hepatoma or DMA/J mammary adenocarcinoma cells, suggesting that the action of amiloride on tumor growth was not due to cell volume changes.

Thirty outpatients with cancer were recruited: 10 with pain due to bone metastasis from the primary cancer site; lung (4), prostate (3), and breast (3) (M group), and 20 with primary cancer of the stomach (11), colon (4), breast (3), lung (1), and bladder (1) with no such evidence of skeletal-related events (non-M group). None of the patients in the M group either needed morphine for pain relief or had hypercalcemia, although all of them had been taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). During the study, they continued taking NSAIDs, as they had before the study. The level of urinary cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen (NTx) at baseline was significantly higher in the M group than in the non-M group ( P < 0.01). Oral administration of etidronate (400 mg/day for 2 weeks) to patients in the M group significantly reduced bone pain 2 and 12 weeks after the start of treatment; however, the pain relief effect was diminished 12 weeks after the start of treatment, despite a significant decrease in urinary NTx level ( P < 0.05 by one-way analysis of variance [ANOVA] with repeated measurements). The present study provides evidence suggesting that patients with painful bone metastases from primary cancer sites may have a higher level of urinary NTx than those with no evidence of skeletal-related events, and that oral administration of etidronate at the dose we used may have the potential to transiently relieve their bone pain by decreasing abnormally raised bone resorption.

Behavioural and autonomous thermoregulation in a group of nine patients with spinal cord transection was compared against a control group of six non-disabled under various room-climate conditions. Deviation of core temperature from thermoregulatory set point was estimated using a behavioural indicator (thermal alliesthesial responses) at different intervals of the exposure time. General thermal comfort sensation was rated on a subjective thermal comfort scale. The group with spinal cord transections showed, as expected, a state of partial poikilothermia. Mean skin temperature was approximately the same in both groups, but skin temperature distribution was different in the spinal cord transection when compared against the control group. The results of thermal alliesthesial responses indicated that core temperature for those with spinal cord transections were closer to their thermoregulatory set points than in the control group. It has been concluded that under conditions beyond thermal neutrality the spinal man may possess, some time after the injury, a thermoregulatory set point which varies directly with ambient thermal conditions.

Of the 23 patients who were taking oral hypoglycemic agents upon entry, all but 2 were off medication by the end of the program. Of the 17 patients who were taking insulin, all but 4 were off medication at discharge. Two of the four had their insulin reduced by 50% while the remaining two had no major change in their insulin dosage. Fasting blood glucose was reduced from 194.9 +/- 10.1 to 144.6 +/- 7.1 mg/dl. Serum cholesterol was reduced from 225.4 +/- 5.7 to 181.7 +/- 4.9 mg/dl while triglycerides were reduced from 283.7 +/- 28.8 to 186.2 +/- 11.6 mg/dl. The group as a whole lost an average of 4.3 kg/body wt and achieved 40.5% of their desired weight loss.

Ninety-two per cent children with CP resident in Northern England and born 1991-1996 were entered into the study. Participation was measured by the Lifestyle Assessment Score and its six component domain scores. Regression analysis was used to investigate variations in participation. There were 443 children (265 male, 178 female; mean age 4 years 8 months [SD 1 year 1 month] at time of assessment) in the study. In the regression analysis the following factors remained significant with regard to level of participation: type of CP (167 with hemiplegia, and of those remaining 240 with bilateral spasticity); intellectual impairment (105 with IQ<50, 113 with IQ 50 to 70, and 225 with IQ>70); presence of seizures (115 with active epilepsy); walking disability (114 unable to walk, 81 restricted and needing aids, 186 restricted but unaided, 62 unrestricted); communication problems (61 no formal communication, 51 use alternative formal methods, 126 some delay or difficulty, 205 no communication problems). After adjustment for these factors, there were significant variations with regard to level of participation in the Lifestyle Assessment Score by district of residence. The magnitude of these variations in Lifestyle Assessment Score between districts is similar to that accounted for by severe intellectual impairment. Similar models were obtained for four of the six domain scores. For one of these four, restriction of social interaction, the significant variation between districts was minimally influenced by the underlying type of CP, walking ability, or presence of seizures. Higher levels of participation among children with CP are associated with residence in certain districts. This is not attributable to variations in case-mix or functional capacity of the children.

At the beginning of this study she had minimal meaningful spoken output and showed little awareness of her speech despite having relatively well-preserved auditory comprehension. Her spoken output had proved resistant to earlier periods of therapy. In contrast, R.M.M.'s written output showed some ability to access orthographic information and monitoring of this modality was shown by an acute awareness of her errors. A 3-stage therapy programme is described. This was designed to improve R.M.M.'s writing of single words and to encourage use of writing as an alternative means of communication. The initial stage of therapy aimed to increase R.M.M.'s access to written word forms by use of picture stimuli. She showed significant improvement in writing treated items in response to pictures both immediately after therapy and at re-assessment 6 weeks later. Despite the acquisition of these skills, R.M.M. failed to use them in communicative contexts. A second stage of therapy replicated the results of the first and sought to facilitate R.M.M.'s functional use of her written vocabulary by asking her to write words to spoken questions. She again showed improved written naming of the treated items and could now produce written names appropriately in a questionnaire-type assessment. Generalization of this ability extended to items that had not been trained in this way. Functional use of writing in everyday communication remained absent, however. The final stage of therapy made explicit the potential links between items which R.M.M. could now write and functional messages which they might convey. She again showed significant changes in the acquisition of new vocabulary and, encouragingly, progress was also seen in her use of the strategy in functional communication. R.M.M.'s speech is almost entirely incomprehensible. It has remained unchanged for 2 years and has not responded to therapy. Relatively well-preserved auditory comprehension and good monitoring of written output allowed therapy to effectively target a small written vocabulary. Despite significant progress in the acquisition of new items, transfer of this skill to functional communication was initially absent. Further therapy which specifically targeted the impairment causing this failure was needed before functional use was seen. The potential for treating written output in cases of jargon aphasia which have been resistant to therapy for spoken language is discussed.",,Aged;Aphasia/etiology:therapy*;Cerebrovascular Disorders/complications;Communication*;Female;Humans;Language Therapy/methods*;Writing*,"Case Reports,Journal Article",International journal of language & communication disorders / Royal College of Speech & Language Therapists,

This study was designed to evaluate the antitumor effect of HO-221 and to establish the optimum regimen, using seven human gastrointestinal and breast cancers xenografted in nude mice. Better antitumor effect of HO-221 by oral administration was observed when it was suspended in larger volume of the vehicle. Moreover, the effect increased by the multiple intermittent administration compared to the single treatment. Best antitumor effect was observed by oral administration of 75 mg/kg (0.1 ml/10 g mouse body weight) repeated twice weekly for a total of eight times or 300 mg/kg (0.2 ml/10 g mouse body weight) repeated once weekly for a total of four times. The antitumor effects of these two regimens were approximately equal except against H-31, the former regimen being more effective. When the tumor growth inhibition rate (IR) over 58% was rated as ""effective"", the above two regimens were equally effective against 4 of 7 cancers, H-111, H-154, H-143 and H-31.

The incorporation of ketone bodies into fatty acids was significantly greater in the obese rat liver (lean, 1.95 mumol of ketone bodies/liver, versus obese, 35.22 mumol/liver; P less than 0.025). The relative contribution of this pathway to the overall rate of fatty acid synthesis was not affected by genotype and accounted for only 3 to 4% of the fatty acids synthesized. The incorporation of ketone bodies into digitonin precipitable sterols was similar in the two genotypes (lean, 4.5 mmol/liver, versus obese 4.7 mumol/liver; NS). This accounted for 9.2 and 6.3% of the total sterol synthesis in lean and obese rat livers, respectively. The total incorporation of ketone bodies into lipid was 7.5 mumols in the lean rat livers and 42.0 mumoles in the obese (P less than 0.025). The net increase was 35 mumoles incorporated, whereas the net decrease in ketogenesis was 284 mumoles. Thus, although ketone body carbon utilization for lipid synthesis was increased in the liver of the obese rats, this pathway could only account for a fraction of the genotypic difference in ketone body production and was of relatively minor importance as a source of carbon for hepatic fatty acid synthesis in both lean and obese rats.",1990-Nov,"3-Hydroxybutyric Acid;Acetoacetates/metabolism;Animals;Fatty Acids/biosynthesis;Genotype;Hydroxybutyrates/metabolism;Ketone Bodies/metabolism*;Kinetics;Lipids/biosynthesis*;Liver/metabolism*;Male;Obesity/metabolism*;Perfusion;Rats;Rats, Zucker","Journal Article,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",Hormone and metabolic research = Hormon- und Stoffwechselforschung = Hormones et m¨¦tabolisme,"Acetoacetates,Fatty Acids,Hydroxybutyrates,Ketone Bodies,Lipids,3-Hydroxybutyric Acid,acetoacetic acid"

Twenty-three were diagnosed prior to admission as cases of birth asphyxia (5-min Apgar score less than 6), and 36 had signs of persistent fetal circulation with electrocardiographic (ECG) changes of ischemia greater than 24 h after birth. Murmurs of atrioventricular valve regurgitation (AVVR), detected in 28 patients, were confirmed in 23 of the 24 patients investigated. The murmurs resolved over a 2-day to 6-month period (median 6 days). In three patients, AVVR, left ventricular dyskinesia, and ECG anomalies persisted for 2 months (until death), 4 months, and 48 months. Initial ECGs were abnormal in 57 patients, and (of those reviewed) 60% returned to normal over a 6-day to 7-month period (median 2 months). Residual ECG anomalies included second-degree AV block and persistent ST-T wave changes. Ten patients died from noncardiac causes. Neither the presence nor resolution of AVVR correlated significantly with the severity of birth asphyxia using the Apgar score, nor with the severity of the ischemic changes on the ECG.

452,453.0,9276152.0,Hyperalgesia,Hyperalgesia,None,0,0,Kinins and their receptors in hyperalgesia.,"Kinins (bradykinin, kallidin) are produced at sites of injury and inflammation and serve a critical role in signaling tissue distress as well as organising tissue responsiveness to injury. The acute activation and prolonged sensitization of fine afferents, to produce pain and hyperalgesia, are important in the protective responses that occur to minimize further tissue injury. These effects occur via activation of B2 receptors present on sensory neurons, resulting in a change of membrane excitability and altered cellular neurochemistry. B2 receptor activation of a variety of tissues including postganglionic sympathetic fibres stimulates the production of several proinflammatory mediators, including prostanoids and cytokines, which interact with kinins and contribute to inflammation and hyperalgesia. Increased expression of B1 receptors plays a prominent role in inflammatory hyperalgesia, but further characterization of the cellular mechanism is required. A role for kinins and kinin receptors in central pathophysiologies (trauma, ischemia, infection) needs examination. The evidence for modulation of nociception and central pain generation is compelling, as central bradykinin administration causes hyperalgesia, whereas B2 antagonists are antinociceptive. The basis for these effects should be urgently investigated. Such data will add further support to the utilization of bradykinin receptor antagonists for the treatment of peripheral and central pain.",1997-Jun,"Animals;Bradykinin/physiology*;Humans;Hyperalgesia/physiopathology*;Kallidin/physiology*;Nociceptors/physiology;Receptors, Bradykinin/physiology*","Journal Article,Review",Canadian journal of physiology and pharmacology,"Receptors, Bradykinin,Kallidin,Bradykinin"

Prepubertal male rats were divided into the following groups: sham-operated (Sham), BA and blind-anosmic-pinealectomized (BAP). Animals from each group were sacrificed 1, 4 and 8 weeks after the operations. Blinding and anosmia resulted in pineal-dependent decreases in the weight of the testes, accessory organs and anterior pituitaries at 4 and 8 weeks but not 1 week after the operations. Likewise serum PRL levels were significantly decreased in BA rats at 4 and 8 weeks but this effect was not prevented in BAP rats. Hypothalamic dopamine (DA) turnover in BA rats at 1 week was twice that seen in either the Sham or BAP groups at that time; this effect ended by 4 weeks. There were no effects of any treatment on DA turnover at 8 weeks. Finally, PRL cell sensitivity to DA inhibition was determined by measuring the release of PRL from pituitaries incubated in vitro with either vehicle or 5 x 10(-7) M DA. None of the treatments caused significant alterations in the response to DA, though this must be interpreted with caution since only one dose of DA was used.

Our results confirmed a specific fibre type disproportion of MPCM of OSA patients compared to non-OSA ones with a type II predominance and aspecific myopathic changes such as fibrosis and central nuclei. No difference was found in the VLM of the two groups. This finding could be explained by a secondary adaptive transformation consequent to nocturnal upper airway resistance in OSA.

There were few hemispheric findings but a full callosal syndrome including left apraxia to verbal commands, left tactile anomia, left agraphia, right constructional apraxia, failure of blindfolded side-to-side hand replication and form-board testing showing loss of interhemispheric transmission including intermanual interference. The ""draw-a-clock"" test showed left inattention when drawn with the right hand but not the left, and perseveration was noted for spatial tasks done with the right hand and symbolic tasks done with the left. The patient recovered functionally almost completely but testing demonstrated continued loss of interhemispheric transmission. The case is considered of most interest for its potential in explaining phenomena observed in severe unilateral hemispheric lesions. Our findings suggest that perseveration is not a dysfunction of the damaged portion of the brain, but a phenomenon associated with intact brain attempting unfamiliar tasks. The persistence of left hemi-inattention is attributed to the inability of the left hemisphere to utilize spatial information to compensate for the phenomenon of inattention. Left-sided dyskinesia following left hemisphere lesions was attributed to the lack of symbolic information necessary to perform some movements. Dysprosody was attributed to lack of tonal information to the left hemisphere. Recovery of function following severe unilateral lesions may be largely due to compensatory learning by the intact hemisphere and assertion of ipsilateral control.

In order to test this prediction, a modified lexical decision task was employed. Panic disorder subjects and nonclinical control subjects made lexical decisions to neutral word pairs and threatening word pairs. Threatening word pairs consisted of combinations of somatic sensations and catastrophic outcomes (e.g., breathless-suffocate), which have been shown to be of salience to individuals with panic disorder.

In fact, observations carried out on animal and man reveal that, central pain, besides being organic, may be of a functional nature. It may be correlated to the lack of those biochemical mechanisms, which take place in the assimilation of those painful inputs at a cerebral level. Particularly pain may be caused by a lack of the 5HT turn-over. As a result of experiments carried out on animals, this takes the role of mediating pain inhibition, being present in the modulation stage of those multi-integrated processes which permit the central perception of pain. Some biochemical and pharmacological clinical observations suggest a serotonin lack in patients affected by essential headaches. A special interest is established by the reciprocal involvement of ancestral functions in essential headaches, such as: emotion, sleep, appetite, vomit, thermoregulation and sex, which are functions directly or undirectly controlled by serotonin. In the therapeutic field, the apparent contradiction between the benefit achieved by anti-serotonin drugs (such as: ergotamine, methisergide, org. G.C. 94 and LSD-25 at non-hallucinogen doses) and the substances with pro-serotonin activity (L-triptophane and L-5 hydroxy-triptophane) supports the hypothesis of a central lack of 5HT, due to the fact that the recent experiments on animal and man have shown a serotonin compatibility by ""antiserotonin"" drugs, when they are administered at therapeutic doses.

492,493.0,9609083.0,"Hypertension;Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular",Body Weight,None,0,0,Left ventricular geometry and severe left ventricular hypertrophy in children and adolescents with essential hypertension.,"BACKGROUND: Left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy has been established as an
independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease in adults. Recent research has
refined this relationship by determining a cutpoint of 51 g/m(2.7) for LV mass
index indicative of increased risk and defining LV geometric patterns that are
associated with increased risk. The purpose of this study was to evaluate severe 
LV hypertrophy and LV geometry in children and adolescents with essential
hypertension.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A cross-sectional study of young patients (n=130) with
persistent blood pressure elevation above the 90th percentile was conducted.
Nineteen patients (14%) had LV mass greater than the 99th percentile; 11 of these
were also above the adult cutpoint of 51 g/m(2.7). Males, subjects with greater
body mass index, and those who had lower heart rate at maximum exercise were at
significantly (P<.05) higher risk of severe LV hypertrophy. In addition, 22
patients (17%) had concentric LV hypertrophy, a geometric pattern that is
associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease in adults. Seven
patients had LV mass index above the cutpoint and concentric hypertrophy. No
consistent significant determinants of LV geometry were identified in these
children and adolescents with hypertension.
CONCLUSIONS: Severe LV hypertrophy and abnormal LV geometry are relatively

The study was carried out in 400 patients (pts) with NQMI (mean age 51) and 485 pts with QMI (mean age 53). Both groups were compared. We have analysed the following parameters: the dynamics of ischaemic heart disease (unstable angina, reinfarction, arrhythmias, mortality) and coronary arteriography. During 8 year observation unstable angina and arrhythmias, were statistically more frequent in pts after NQMI. Recurrent myocardial infarction occurred in 196 (49%) of pts after NQMI and only in 87 pts (18%) after QMI (p less than 0.001). However, the difference in mortality between both groups was not significant (37% vs 39% respectively). Coronary angiography was performed at 1-6 months after myocardial infarction.

Frequently, however, only symptomatic therapy is possible. Urge incontinence or overactive bladder due to obstruction should primarily be treated by eliminating the obstruction. Medical and surgical treatment methods are available for benign prostatic hyperplasia, bladder neck hypertrophy and prostatic cancer. In contrast, bladder neck sclerosis and uretheral strictures can only be treated surgically. Anticholinergics are primarily indicated if urge symptoms/incontinence persist after obstruction has been relieved or if urge incontinence occurs without obstruction. Seldom, in special cases injection of Botulinustoxin A or augmentation of the bladder may be indicated. Another possible cause of urge symptoms is urinary tract infection. This should be adequately treated according to resistance studies and the cause of the infection determined. In cases of overflow incontinence the infravesicle obstruction must be sought and treated. If limited detrusor contractability is the cause of overflow incontinence and the bladder cannot be emptied through pressmicturition, parasympathicometics may be of help. By insufficient effect, the procedure of intermittent self-catheterization must be taught. If this is not possible, the last resort is placement of a transuretheral or percutaneous catheter for continuous drainage. Stress incontinence is a rare complication in men, usually following prostatic surgery. It can be treated conservatively with pelvic floor training and alpha-adrenergic receptor agonists and if necessary surgically with submucosal collagen or silicon injections in the sphincter area or implantation of a sphincter prosthesis. Supravesicular urinary diversion is occasionally necessary after conservative and less invasive surgical measures have been exhausted and symptomatic suffering persists.

Across five measurement sessions, sound pressure levels at the center of the head gradient coil ranged from 122 to 131 dB SPL [123 to 132 dB(A)]. For protection against damaging noise exposure, UK and US industrial guidelines stipulate that the maximum permitted daily noise dosage is equivalent to 90 dB(A) for 8 hours, where noise dosage is a function of the level of an acoustic signal and the length of exposure to it. Without hearing protection, this equivalent level would be exceeded by less than 5 seconds of exposure to the measured levels of scanner acoustic noise.

All three mediators are coupled to signaling pathways that potentially induce rises in intracellular calcium concentration in other models. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate if the three mediators cause calcium rises in isolated rat sensory neurons that may explain their sensitizing action. Neurons exposed to serotonin, bradykinin, and prostaglandin E(2) exhibited reversible increases in intracellular calcium concentration, which were absent in calcium-free solution. The calcium increase induced by serotonin was preserved in the presence of extracellular cadmium suggesting calcium influx potentially through the serotonin receptor ion channel 5-HT(3). The bradykinin-induced calcium response was slower, showed pronounced tachyphylaxis and was absent in the presence of extracellular cadmium ions. Similar results were obtained for prostaglandin E(2) although the calcium rises were fast and not prone to tachyphylaxis. This suggests that prostaglandin E(2) as well as bradykinin via activation of G protein-coupled receptors seem to couple to calcium-permeant ion channels possibly the heat-transducing vanilloid receptor type 1 or related ion channels. The three mediators, however, did not cooperate to induce supra-additive calcium responses when applied simultaneously. In summary, our results suggest that the inflammatory mediators serotonin, prostaglandin E(2) and bradykinin induce calcium influx in sensory neurons.

515,516.0,10771794.0,"Lung Diseases, Obstructive",Anoxia,None,0,0,The demographics and economics of long-term oxygen therapy.,"Home oxygen therapy represents a scientifically validated and universally accepted therapeutic regimen for the treatment of chronic hypoxemia secondary to COPD. The clinical benefits of home oxygen, including a decrease in morbidity and often a concomitant increase in the quality of life have been repeatedly confirmed through rigorous worldwide trials, studies, and investigations. However, since home oxygen is an expensive treatment modality, important questions continue to be raised about the overall cost-benefit of the intervention. Such scrutiny is expected to continue, especially in the United States, as the entire issue of health care cost-containment remains atop the domestic political agenda. Providers of home oxygen therapy have traditionally realized quite favorable reimbursement for home oxygen equipment, especially for those patient-customers covered under the Medicare program. However, recent Medicare reimbursement reductions of more than 30% have raised serious questions about the ability of home oxygen providers, especially those with annual revenues less than $1 million, to sustain their historical high level of support services to home oxygen patient-customers. Of particular concern is the economic hardship of supplying portable oxygen, especially for those patient-customers with unusually high ambulatory needs. The use of oxygen-conserving devices is viewed by some as one strategy to better control the costs of supplying portable oxygen, although there are those who still question whether or not oxygen-conserving devices can effectively forestall arterial oxygen desaturation across the entire spectrum of ambulation. Given the evidence now being reported that compliance in using home oxygen as prescribed may well be much lower than originally believed, the time is probably right to revisit the role played by home oxygen providers in determining continuing need through the performance of periodic reassessments. Such reassessments, if designed according to prescribed and validated protocols and conducted by home respiratory therapists under orders of the prescribing physician, would be a valuable tool to ensure continued medical need and identifying noncompliance. This would help ensure that those needing and using home oxygen would continue to receive the benefit. At the same time, patient-customers who, for one reason or another, stop using their oxygen equipment despite repeated encouragement, would have the equipment removed. The net result would be that reimbursement dollars currently wasted on home oxygen equipment that is not being used could be reallocated for those patient-customers willing and able to use the equipment as prescribed.",2000-Feb,"Anoxia/therapy;Demography;Home Care Services/economics*:utilization*;Humans;Long-Term Care;Lung Diseases, Obstructive/therapy*;Medicare/economics;Oxygen Inhalation Therapy/economics*:utilization*;Patient Compliance;United States","Journal Article,Review",Respiratory care,

In a retrospective study of 19 patients, we used the turns-amplitude analysis of the EMG interference pattern for the evaluation of electrophysiological changes as a function of time after BT treatment. EMG was performed immediately before and during injection, and muscles showing abnormally increased activity (> 100 turns/s at rest) were given botulinum toxin A (Oculinum (= Botox)) 40-120 units. A second EMG was done 6-30 weeks later. At attempted rest, the sternocleidomastoid muscle contralateral to the involuntary head rotation showed the most pronounced changes, possibly due to relatively large doses of BT, and the EMG changes were related to the time after BT treatment. Six weeks after treatment the muscle showed decreased turns/s, mean amplitude and ratio (turns/amplitude) at rest. At 30 weeks, turns and mean amplitude reached values as before treatment, while ratio was increased to 175% of the pre-treatment value. This pattern may reflect a reversible and random loss of muscles fibres, due to presynaptic denervation.

523,524.0,9854265.0,Persistent Vegetative State;Unconsciousness,Persistent Vegetative State;Unconsciousness,None,0,0,Coordinated expression in chronically unconscious persons.,"The clinically described 'persistent vegetative state' (PVS), consists of wakefulness unaccompanied by any evidence of the subject's awareness of self or environment. Past studies from our own and other laboratories have used positron emission tomography (PET) to study brain metabolism in approximately 20 such patients during wakeful periods. All those efforts identified global cerebral glucose metabolism at or below levels encountered during deep barbiturate anaesthesia. Nevertheless, the clinical literature includes rare reports of relatively isolated cognitive functions expressed by PVS patients late in their course. The observation raises the question of whether such activity reflects awareness or unconscious automatic behaviour. We employed magnetometry (MEG), PET scanning, MR imaging and 24-hour EEG recordings to evaluate three patients clinically vegetative between six months and 20 years after onset. Neither meticulous clinical examinations nor 24-hour EEG and video monitoring provided any hint of cognitive interaction in any subject. Nevertheless, patient 1 uttered single words once every 48 hours or more; patient 2 frequently expressed coordinated, non-purposeful, non-dystonic movements in arms and/or legs; and, patient 3 expressed strong emotional negativity without motor responses to noxious stimuli with occasional quieting in response to prosodic stimuli. All patients had whole-brain averaged global metabolism levels below 50% of normal. Patient 1, however, demonstrated preserved islands of increased metabolism in the posterior frontal and posterior temporal lobes, as well as MEG activations of Heschl's gyrus all located in the left hemisphere. In patient 2, selected increased metabolism was confined to the frontal poles and related subcortical structures. MRI in patient 3 demonstrated severe, bilateral post-traumatic cerebral atrophy. PET metabolism was diffusely reduced to 40% of normal but MEG evoked potentials indicated early and late sensory processing with abnormal later evoked components. The correlation of fragmentary behaviour with preserved metabolic and physiologic activity in cortical and subcortical regions known to support specific modular functions is novel. The finding demonstrates the capacity of severely damaged brains to partially express surviving modular functions without evidence of integrative processes that would be necessary to produce consciousness. We conclude that the mere expression of isolated neuropsychologic activity by isolated modules is insufficient to generate consciousness in overwhelmingly damaged brains.",1998-Nov-29,"Adult;Brain/metabolism:physiopathology*:radionuclide imaging;Brain Injuries/metabolism:physiopathology;Electroencephalography;Female;Glucose/metabolism;Humans;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Magnetics;Male;Middle Aged;Persistent Vegetative State/physiopathology*;Tomography, Emission-Computed;Unconsciousness/physiopathology*","Case Reports,Journal Article,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

Persistent fever was the most frequent reason for altering treatment which was done empirically in 90% of cases, but two-thirds of patients required further treatment modification. An infectious focus mainly involving the lung developed during granulocytopenia in 21 patients (30%), of which 17 occurred during antimicrobial therapy. Only 1 infection was shown to be due to bacteria, while 7 were due to fungi. Amikacin levels were similar to those expected following a normal dose (mean peak of 34.7 and mean trough of 12.6 mg/l). Therapy with the combination resulted in a higher serum creatinine (p less than 0.001) and a lower potassium level (p less than 0.001) in comparison with monotherapy. Potassium supplementation was required in 45 +/- 17% of patients given the combination compared with only 4 +/- 7% of those treated with ceftazidime. While both regimens appeared to be equally effective as initial therapy, the need for modification was high in both patient groups.

Most children with fecal soiling due to organic disease continue with some degree of incontinence despite optimal medical management. Antegrade enema administration helps those with severe fecal incontinence due to organic causes who do not respond to medical management.

The aim of the present study was to examine the severity of dieting and its association with obesity, body satisfaction and psychological problems in female adolescents. A representative sample of 800 girls aged 14-19 years were approached during the period of October to December 2004, and 566 girls gave consent and participated in the study, thus giving a response rate of 70.8%. Self-reports were obtained from 566 teenage girls using the Adolescent Dieting Scale and the Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20) for psychopathology. Subjects were classified into three categories: acceptable weight (BMI < 25 kg m(-2)); overweight (BMI 25-29.9 kg m(-2)); and obese (BMI > 30 kg m(-2)). The prevalence of overweight and obesity for female adolescents were 13.4% vs. 1.8%; 39.9% were intermediate dieters, and 8.3% were extreme dieters. Dieting was not associated with age but was significantly associated with body mass index (BMI) (P = 0.045). Extreme dieting was strongly associated with peer perception of respondent's figure (P < 0.001) and self-perception of figure (P = 0.016).

The tremor is accompanied with locomotor hyperactivity without rigidity and immobility of the whole body, suggesting the involvement of the mechanism associated with the movement. The tail-tremor induced by nicotine was suppressed by nicotinic acethylcholine (nACh) receptor antagonists, but not by muscarinic acethylcholine (mACh) receptor antagonists. Moreover, the tail-tremor was suppressed by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists and benzodizepines. The tremor at rest is observed only in Parkinson's disease, which is improved by the use of mACh receptor antagonists. An essential tremor is one of the typical tremor connected with the movement (postural tremor) and improved with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. These findings and results suggest that the nicotine-induced tail-tremor is useful for the study of the essential tremor as an animal model. On the other hand, daily administration of nicotine resulted in an augmentation of the tail-tremor. The development of the tail-tremor was suppressed by nACh receptor antagonists, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists and nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitors.

The study of cold allodynia in animals can help us to understand the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of neuropathic pain and to validate drugs. The evaluation of cold allodynia in gerbils with a chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve on the cold plate is not always stable. We developed a new application method of acetone using a specific spray technique with an Eppendorf multistepper pipette. The chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve in gerbils resulted in a long-lasting mechanical and acetone spray-induced hyperreactivity throughout the testing period, which is clearly different from what was seen in sham-operated animals. The acetone spray test incorporates a multimodal stimulus different from direct cold stimulation. The reactivity to the acetone spray coincides in time and strength with the reactivity observed in mechanical allodynia in gerbils and with mechanical and thermal allodynia in other species. Furthermore, a pharmacological validation of the acetone spray test by different reference compounds was performed.

An investigation of the non-stimulated secretion of some of the hormones influencing metabolism was undertaken by evaluating thyroxine, iodothyronine binding index, testosterone, growth hormone, calcitonin, and parathyroid hormone in venous blood of fasting healthy subjects and quadriplegic patients. The effect of the duration of the paralysis was examined by repeating the evaluations at different periods after onset. The results show that 1) thyroxine was low for 2 months after onset in 21 patients and normal thereafter in 53 patients, 2) testosterone was low throughout the study in 62 patients; the decrease is greatest during the first 2 months, 3) growth hormone was often increased in 46 patients for 8 months after onset, and nearly normal afterward in 25 patients, 4) calcitonin was normal in 22 patients throughout the study, and 5) parathyroid hormone was normal in relation to normal serum calcium as early as 6 days after onset in 79 out of 83 patients. These data do not preclude a parathyroid hormone increase at onset or alterations in the patterns of circadian secretion and in the responses to specific stimulation for the hormones evaluated. Therefore, it may be concluded only that the steady state secretion of these hormones is not altered by traumatic quadriplegia per se, but is temporarily modified by the original insult to the nervous system, and by changes in life pattern and the heavy sedation that follows.

In these 2 groups, there was no difference in the ability of insulin to induce autophosphorylation of the IR, phosphorylation of the downstream serine kinase Akt/PKB, or stimulation of glucose transport. Moreover, there were no major differences in cultured muscle cell content of either the IR, the IR antagonist PC-1, or GLUT 1 and GLUT 4.

Platelet MAO activity is an index of brain serotonin activity and lowered platelet MAO levels have been found in association with impulsive behaviors. In addition, some preliminary reports indicate that platelet MAO could be lowered in eating disorder patients. Methods: 47 patients with DSM-IV eating disorders were studied, including 30 with bulimia nervosa and 17 with anorexia nervosa binge eating-purging type. Platelet MAO activity was measured by isotopic methods using C-14 benzylamine and compared with a control group of 30 healthy subjects. Impulsive personality features were studied with specific rating scales. Results: Platelet MAO activity was significantly lower (4.4+/-2.4 nmol/h/10(8) platelets) in the bulimic patients than in the control group (6.9+/-2.5) (p<0.001). No significant differences were found between pure bulimics and binge eating-purging anorectics.

This study aimed at assessing the hemodynamics at the bifurcation of the main pulmonary artery using Doppler echocardiography and to correlate the results with this murmur. The peak velocities of main pulmonary artery (MPAV) and right pulmonary artery (RPAV) were studied in 25 low-birth-weight infants who had recovered from acute stage and presented with a systolic murmur, and the ratio of RPAV/MPAV was calculated. Another compatible 25 healthy low-birth-weight infants without a murmur were enrolled as the control group. The initial MPAV values were 79.8 +/- 20.7 (range 51-152) cm/s and 80.7 +/- 14.2 (range 60-111) cm/s in the heart murmur group and in the control group, respectively (p > 0.05). The initial RPAV values were 193.4 +/- 60.2 (range 118-388) cm/s and 99.8 +/- 15.5 (range 76-132) cm/s in the heart murmur group and in the control group, respectively (p < 0.0001). The initial RPAV/MPAV ratios were 2.46 +/- 0.61 (1.59-3.92) and 1.25 +/- 0.14 (0.94-1.47) in the heart murmur group and in the control group respectively (p < 0.0001). When the murmur disappeared after a period of 2-5 months, no significant differences in the last RPAV and RPAV/MPAV ratios between both groups could be found. The RPAV in the heart murmur group faded significantly to 118.7 +/- 16.9 cm/s, and so did the RPAV/MPAV ratio to 1.24 +/- 0.12 (p < 0.0001). A transient functional murmur recognized in healthy premature infants at about 1 month of age is caused by the pressure gradient that implies a physiological stenosis at the bifurcation of the main pulmonary artery.

In ALS, a reduction of Vmax and Vmin, and an increase of Vmax-Vmin were found in both median and posterior tibial nerve. In BSMA, a reduction of Vmin and an increase of Vmax-Vmin in the median nerve were noted. Some patients whose results of conventional nerve conduction study were entirely within normal range showed abnormal results in Vmin and/or Vmax-Vmin.

Rats were chronically fed food containing diazepam on an escalating drug dosage schedule, from 1 and 2 to 12 mg/g of food, over a period of 30 days. During treatment, the growth curve in LEW and F344 rats was suppressed compared with the respective controls. Motor incoordination was evaluated by a rotarod performance test. The ranking of the motor incoordination during the final concentration of diazepam was as follows: F344 greater than LEW. After substitution of normal food for the diazepam-admixed food, various signs of diazepam withdrawal occurred 16-120 h later. These signs included vocalization, irritability, muscle rigidity, ear-twitching, Straub's tail, piloerection, fascicular twitch, tremor, convulsion, and death. The incidences of vocalization, ear-twitching, piloerection, and tremor in F344 were significantly higher than those in LEW rats. Furthermore, two of six F344 rats showed spontaneous convulsions and one rat died of convulsions. Overall withdrawal scores were significantly greater in F344 (16.0) than in LEW (6.3) rats.

The detection of antibodies by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and traditional methods against phase I whole cells, phase II whole cells, and phase I lipopolysaccharide (LPS-I) (a virulence marker for phase I cells) antigens in the serum samples of infected animals revealed marked differences between intrastrain phase variants. Animals infected with the phase I Nine Mile strain produced a concomitant increase in temperature, circulating infectious C. burnetii cells, and antibodies against phase II cells, phase I cells, and LPS-I. At 15 weeks, a challenge of phase I-infected animals with viable phase I cells resulted in anamnestic antibody responses to phase I cells and LPS-I but not to phase II cells. Infection of animals with the phase II Nine Mile strain produced antibodies against only phase II cells. The challenge of phase II-infected animals at 15 weeks with viable phase II cells resulted in anamnestic antibody responses to phase I and phase II cells but not to LPS-I. Suppression of anti-phase II responses by the phase I challenge was apparent with only the ELISA, because the immunofluorescence, microagglutination, and complement fixation assays were insensitive to these changes. The sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA with whole-cell and the LPS-I antigens in the detection of phase-specific antibody revealed that avirulent phase II cells induced an immune response to phase I antigenic epitopes. Although the avirulent phase II cells were rapidly cleared by the host immune responses, they were sufficiently infective to induce antibody responses to both phase variants.

During the first 12 weeks, half the subjects were provided a 1000 kcal/day low-calorie diet (LCD), compromised of portion-controlled foods, whereas the other half were prescribed a 1200 kcal/day balanced deficit diet (BDD) consisting of self-selected table foods. Thereafter, subjects in both conditions were instructed to consume approximately 1200-1800 kcal/day of self-selected foods, depending on their desired weight change. During the first 6 weeks, weight and serum leptin fell significantly more (P < 0.05) in women in the LCD condition than in the BDD condition. In the former group, the 55% reduction in baseline leptin was 10 times greater than the relative reduction in body weight. Stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that degree of caloric restriction, but not weight loss, contribution significantly to the variance in the change in leptin at week 6. By contrast, long-term changes in leptin, when subjects had increased their calorie intake, were more strongly related to changes in weight and fat. At week 40, for example, weight loss account for 47% of the variance in the change in leptin. Serum leptin and body fat remained highly correlated after weight loss (r = 0.79, P < 0.001), as before (r = 0.66, P < 0.001). After treatment, however, we observed a greater-than-expected reduction in serum leptin concentrations, as expressed per kilogram of body fat.

It appears that the pathogenesis of unstable angina involves endothelial factors (plaque rupture of fissure resulting in a complex coronary stenotic lesion) together with dynamic factors (including platelet aggregation, thrombosis, and altered coronary vasomotor tone), and therefore it is clear why the approach to the patient with acute coronary syndromes has become multidimensional. This article summarizes the current views of the pathogenesis of unstable angina, and the role that the above factors may play in the clinical syndrome of acute coronary insufficiency. In addition, the newer therapeutic approaches to the pharmacologic management of unstable angina are discussed, including the use of nitrates, heparin, aspirin, and beta-blockers. Increasingly, calcium-channel blockers are being utilized in the early pharmacologic management of unstable angina, particularly because these agents have a salutary effect on reducing increased coronary vasomotor tone, reducing myocardial oxygen demand while at the same time augmenting coronary blood flow, and decreasing platelet aggregation. Numerous small clinical trials have examined the role of intravenous calcium-channel-blocker therapy for the acute management of unstable angina. In particular, intravenous diltiazem appears to be both safe and efficacious in this setting, and may offer some advantages to intravenous nitroglycerin, when used in the Coronary Care Unit setting. Because diltiazem is a heart rate-lowering vasoactive drug, it may attenuate myocardial ischemia without causing reflex tachycardia associated with other vasoactive pharmacologic therapies. Several of these studies utilizing intravenous diltiazem in unstable angina are reviewed and discussed.",1991,"Angina, Unstable/drug therapy*:etiology;Clinical Trials as Topic;Diltiazem/administration & dosage*:therapeutic use;Humans;Injections, Intravenous;Nitroglycerin/therapeutic use;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","Comparative Study,Journal Article,Review",Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology,"Diltiazem,Nitroglycerin"

The third family presents very high expression of a folate sensitive site, unlinked to mental retardation, and was described previously by Voelckel et al. [1989]. The fragile sites in these or similar families recently described must be different from the one associated with the fra(X) syndrome. Their association with a clinical phenotype or with mental retardation is certainly not consistent, and may represent an ascertainment bias. However, the relatively high frequency with which they have been found among previously diagnosed fra(X) families suggests that, at least in some cases, the association with mental impairment may be significant. In two families reported up to now, a male with high expression of such variant fra(X) site failed to transmit it to his daughter, which may reflect an imprinting effect.

Amylin is stored and released together with insulin and has been proposed to play a major role in the pathogenesis of type II diabetes. To compare amylin release and its proportion to insulin secretion under different metabolic conditions, oral and intravenous glucose tolerance tests (OGTT and IVGTT, respectively) were performed in healthy, lean control subjects, obese patients with normal and impaired glucose tolerance (NGT and IGT, respectively), and obese type II diabetic patients. Compared with control subjects, basal and stimulated amylin secretion during OGTT was significantly higher in obese patients with NGT and IGT but not in type II diabetic patients. The integrated amylin response was significantly higher in obese patients with NGT than lean control subjects and type II diabetic patients matched for degree of obesity. The amylin-insulin ratio decreased slightly in obese subjects with NGT and IGT and significantly in type II diabetic patients. Amylin secretion was significantly stimulated during IVGTT in control subjects and obese patients with NGT and IGT but not in type II diabetic patients. These findings suggest that amylin is physiologically released by pancreatic beta-cells in a constant ratio to insulin in nondiabetic subjects.

In type II diabetes mellitus, amylin secretion relative to that of insulin is decreased, and amylin is not stimulated by IVGTT.",1991-Dec,"Adult;Amyloid/blood:secretion*;Biological Markers/blood;Blood Glucose/metabolism*;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/blood*;Glucose Tolerance Test;Humans;Insulin/blood:secretion*;Islet Amyloid Polypeptide;Kinetics;Obesity/blood;Prediabetic State/blood;Radioimmunoassay;Reference Values;Time Factors",Journal Article,Diabetes,"Amyloid,Biological Markers,Blood Glucose,Insulin,Islet Amyloid Polypeptide"

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that systemic treatment with IGF-I could inhibit death of neuroretinal cells in diabetic rats by examining the expression of proapoptotic markers. In diabetic rat retina, the number of TUNEL-immunoreactive cells increased approximately sixfold in the photoreceptor layer (P<.001) and eightfold in the inner nuclear layer (INL; P<.001); phospho-Akt (p-Akt; Thr 308) immunoreactivity increased eightfold in the ganglion cell layer (GCL; P<.001) and threefold in the INL (P<.01). Subcutaneous IGF-I treatment significantly reduced the number of TUNEL (P<.001) and p-Akt immunoreactive retinal cells (P<.05) in diabetic rats approximately to the level of the nondiabetic group. Qualitative results showed that caspase-3 and BAD immunoreactivities were also elevated in diabetes and reduced in IGF-I-treated animals. Elevated TUNEL and p-Akt immunoreactivities were localized to distinct cell layers in the retina of diabetic rats. Early intervention with systemic IGF-I reduced the presence of proapoptotic markers indicative of neuroretinal cell death, despite ongoing hyperglycemia and weight loss.

After a critical review of the vast old and recent literature on the matter, a physiopathological interpretation of the clinical association is put forward on the basis of mental, nervous and endocrine correlations in carbohydrate metabolism, with special reference to manic-depressive psychosis. The insulin-like effect of lithium on carbohydrate metabolism and correlated ions (phosphates, calcium, magnesium, potassium) at cell membrane level is then discussed. Theoretical and practical conclusions are drawn on the basis of these data. The former propose an essentially ""structural"" or ""intersection"" hypothesis of the association and suggest depth study of the insulin function especially in the ""normal"" phase of manic-depressive psychosis. The latter show the possibility of a clinical trial with lithium and other anti-depressant drugs in obese diabetics, with a close cooperation between psychiatrist and diabetologist.",,Adult;Age Factors;Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy:etiology*:metabolism;Carbohydrate Metabolism;Diabetes Complications*;Diabetes Mellitus/metabolism;Humans;Lithium/therapeutic use;Obesity*,"English Abstract,Journal Article",Archivio per le scienze mediche,Lithium

Caloric and audiometric tests confirmed bilateral impairment of the audiovestibular organ. A week later she also developed bilateral iritis and papillitis.

We examined the influence of add-on ANG II receptor blockade administered as losartan (50 mg/day for 1 mo) on oxidative stress and proinflammatory state of the kidney in patients with CKD. All subjects were taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor plus other antihypertensive agents. Oxidative stress to lipids and proteins was measured by an HPLC assay for malondialdehyde (MDA) and carbonyl concentration, respectively. Urinary inflammation was measured by monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) excretion rate. The etiology of CKD was type 2 diabetes mellitus in 12 and glomerulonephritis in 4 patients. There was no change in proteinuria or 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (BP) with add-on ANG II receptor blockade with losartan therapy. Before losartan therapy, urinary protein and albumin oxidation were 99 and 71% higher, respectively, compared with in plasma (P < 0.05). There was a 35% reduction in urinary oxidized albumin with add-on losartan therapy (P = 0.036). Urinary and plasma MDA were elevated compared with age-matched controls. Urinary MDA was significantly reduced from 4.75 +/- 3.23 to 3.39 +/- 2.17 micromol/g creatinine with add-on losartan therapy. However, plasma MDA or oxidized proteins did not change in response to additional ANG II blockade. A good correlation was seen between the change in urinary oxidized albumin and MCP-1 levels (r = 0.61, P = 0.012). These data demonstrate that oxidative damage to urinary protein and lipids can be reduced with additional ANG II receptor blockade, independently of reductions in proteinuria or BP. Urinary measurements of markers of oxidative damage to lipids and proteins appear to be more sensitive than plasma measurements in patients with CKD. The significant association of the change in urinary MCP-1 with a reduction in oxidative stress supports the role of the redox state in the kidney with renal fibrosis and progressive kidney damage.",2003-Apr,"Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists*;Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use;Antihypertensive Agents/therapeutic use;Biological Markers/blood:urine;Blood Pressure/drug effects;Chemokine CCL2/urine;Chronic Disease;Cross-Over Studies;Cytokines/urine;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications;Drug Therapy, Combination;Female;Glomerular Filtration Rate/drug effects;Glomerulonephritis/complications;Humans;Kidney Failure, Chronic/drug therapy*:etiology:metabolism*;Lipids/urine;Losartan/therapeutic use*;Male;Malondialdehyde/blood:urine;Middle Aged;Oxidative Stress/drug effects*;Proteinuria/drug therapy:urine;Receptor, Angiotensin, Type 1;Serum Albumin/analysis:metabolism","Clinical Trial,Journal Article,Randomized Controlled Trial,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",American journal of physiology.

If conservative treatment is started early, with a regimen of passive stretching exercises and active strengthening of the contralateral muscle, about 95% of patients achieve an acceptable range of neck movement. The surgical management of patients who do not respond to physiotherapy remains controversial. Its aim is to provide a long-term, cosmetic restoration of neck mobility while minimizing the development of craniofacial deformity and upper cervical scoliosis; few previously advocated techniques achieve both these goals. We describe a technique that combines subperiosteal lengthening of the sternocleidomastoid muscle at its mastoid insertion, and division of lower fibrotic bands with minimal postoperative fibrosis. As the sternomastoid muscle is reattached lower down on the mastoid process, the lengthening of the muscle is stable, because the tendency to fibrosis and shortening is minimized.

Hypothesizing that leptin binding proteins may regulate the functional efficiency of leptin, we characterized auxologic and hormonal factors that influence leptin binding in three disparate groups: normal adolescents, obese children, and teenagers with type I diabetes mellitus (IDDM). Specific leptin binding activity (sLBA) was assessed by column chromatography after incubation of serum with 125I-leptin in the presence and absence of excess unlabeled leptin. Mean sLBA was 17.0 +/- 7% (SD) in the healthy adolescents (n=41), 6.6 +/-4.3% in the obese children (n=26), and 14.9 +/-7.3% in the diabetic teenagers (n=17). At any value of sLBA, obese children had higher serum leptin levels than non-obese adolescents or diabetic teenagers, consistent with ""leptin resistance"" in the obese group. sLBA was higher in males than in females only in those with diabetes (18.6 +/- 7.3 vs 10.9 +/- 5.1%, p<0.05). sLBA correlated inversely with serum insulin-like growth factor-I values in the normal group (r= -0.45, p<0.01) and with insulin in the obese children (r= -0.53, p<0.01). There was no correlation between sLBA or serum leptin values and HbA1c, in the diabetic group. The serum leptin concentration was the principal determinant explaining the total variability of sLBA in all three cohorts. However, body mass index (BMI = weight/ height2) accounted for more of the total variability of percent specific binding in the healthy adolescents than in the other groups. We conclude that sLBA reflects circulating leptin levels, body composition, and hormonal milieu. Thus, in addition to leptin, qualitative and quantitative characteristics of leptin binding may play a physiological role in the regulation of appetite and in the ""leptin resistance"" of obesity.",2000-Feb,"Adolescent;Body Mass Index;Case-Control Studies;Child;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/blood*:physiopathology;Female;Humans;Leptin/blood*;Male;Obesity/blood*;Protein Binding",Journal Article,Journal of pediatric endocrinology & metabolism : JPEM,Leptin

The dichotomy of modest, persistent elevations of troponins I and T as prognostic factors in patients with unstable angina and absent elevations of isoenzymes of creatine kinase is presently unexplained. Factors influencing the appearance of macromolecular markers of myocardial injury in blood are considered, including the need to estimate baseline values, to consider elevations as deviations from baseline rather than simply points within a distribution of baseline values in normal subjects, to recognize operative biochemical and physiologic determinants of marker release from injured myocytes and washout and to take into account the influence of apoptosis. Elucidation and consideration of mechanisms underlying the appearance of specific macromolecular markers in blood appear likely to improve diagnosis and explain the prognostic power of the troponins in patients with unstable angina.

Accordingly, blood flow was determined (via radioactive microspheres) in rats with a small infarction (MI less than 30%) and in rats with a large (MI greater than 30%) infarction, induced by surgically ligating the left main coronary artery, and compared with rats that had received a sham operation. Results demonstrate that blood flow to the hindlimb musculature was significantly (P less than 0.05) less during a given level of treadmill exercise (20% grade and speed of 28 m/min) in the MI groups of rats compared with their sham counterparts. These differences in hindlimb blood flow were the result of blood flow deficits found in the individual muscles of the thigh and leg. Moreover, the blood flow deficits were more pronounced in the MI greater than 30% group of rats compared with the MI less than 30% group. The blood flow deficits found for the MI greater than 30% group of rats were positively correlated with the percentage of fast-twitch oxidative-glycolytic fibers and negatively correlated with the percentage of fast-twitch glycolytic fibers found in the individual muscles.

The present study examined the effect of a selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, sarpogrelate, on hyperalgesia and allodynia induced by thermal injury in rats. Mild thermal injury to the hindpaw produces thermal hyperalgesia in the injured area (primary thermal hyperalgesia) and mechanical allodynia in sites adjacent to the primary area (secondary mechanical allodynia). Mechanical allodynia was assessed by paw withdrawal thresholds using von Frey filaments, and thermal hyperalgesia was assessed by paw withdrawal latencies upon exposure to a radiant heat source. Intraperitoneal administration (30-100 mg/kg) or local injection (30-300 microg) of sarpogrelate 10 min prior to thermal injury attenuated secondary mechanical allodynia in a dose-dependent manner. Intraperitoneal administration (3-100 mg/kg) or local injection (30-300 microg) of sarpogrelate 10 min prior to thermal injury attenuated primary thermal hyperalgesia in a dose-dependent manner. Intraplantar injection of sarpogrelate (300 microg) to the contralateral hindpaw had no effect on primary thermal hyperalgesia or secondary mechanical allodynia in the ipsilateral paw. The tissue concentration of 5-HT was measured using microdialysis. Concentrations of 5-HT increased after thermal injury in both primary and secondary areas, and the increase was not attenuated by pretreatment with sarpogrelate (100 mg/kg, i.p.). These data suggest that 5-HT released in peripheral tissues after thermal injury sensitizes primary afferent neurons and produces mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia via peripheral 5-HT2A receptors.",2006-May,"Animals;Burns/complications:drug therapy:physiopathology*;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Hot Temperature/adverse effects*;Hyperalgesia/etiology:physiopathology*:prevention & control*;Male;Pain Threshold/drug effects;Physical Stimulation/adverse effects*;Rats;Rats, Wistar;Serotonin 5-HT2 Receptor Antagonists*;Serotonin Antagonists/administration & dosage;Succinates/administration & dosage*;Touch;Treatment Outcome","Journal Article,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Pain,"Serotonin 5-HT2 Receptor Antagonists,Serotonin Antagonists,Succinates,sarpogrelate"

This 2-year cohort study describes the long-term follow-up of patients who had severe LV dysfunction that was treated with EECP for angina pectoris and reports clinical outcomes, event-free survival rates, and the incidence of repeat EECP. This study included 363 patients who had refractory angina and LV ejection fraction < or =35%. Most patients reported quality of life as poor.

Fifty-two percent of patients discontinued nitroglycerin use. Quality of life improved substantially. At 2 years this decrease in angina was maintained in 55% of patients. The 2-year survival rate was 83%, and the major adverse cardiovascular event-free survival rate was 70%. Forty-three percent had no reported cardiac hospitalization; 81% had no reported congestive heart failure events. Repeat EECP was performed in 20% of these patients.

In the mid recovery phase graft versus host and its treatment contribute to diminished host defences. Viral infections and fungal infections predominate. In the late recovery phase chronic graft versus host reaction impairs the monocyte macrophage function and CD4 counts are low. In this phase patients are at risk for infections with encapsulated bacteria, fungi, Pneumocystis carinii and Toxoplasma. Strategies for the management of febrile neutropenia are similar to those in 'high risk' neutropenic patients: immediate broad spectrum I.V. antibiotics (3rd or 4th generation cephalosporin+/-aminoglycoside or carbapenem) and early amphothericin B (lipid formulation) if fever persists beyond 5 days despite adequate I.V. antibiotics.

We examined changes in performance with practice of a movement sequence in PD patients and age-matched controls (n = 8 per group). Subjects practiced a complex three-dimensional sequential aiming task over 2 days, completing 180 trials, with the goal to minimize response time within specified accuracy limits. The results indicated that both groups became faster in planning the movement, and both groups moved more quickly through the sequence with practice. The PD group's decrease in movement time occurred primarily within the first 45 trials, whereas the control group continued to improve through the first 150 trials. Flight time (time between targets) to a small target decreased with practice in both groups, but flight time to a large target decreased only in the control group. This finding indicates that error corrective processes are more amenable to practice than ballistic processes in people with PD. There was little evidence that either group improved their performance by planning shorter (lower) trajectories, but rather increased mean velocity.

Obstruction of the SVC is mimicked by few other organic problems. The traditional view of therapy protocols is that treatment can and should be started before an etiologic diagnosis is made. More recent literature holds that difficulties arise when treatment is started before a cause and location are known. The therapy of choice for this localized problem is radiation therapy. High-dose, short-interval radiation is the primary treatment around which diuretics, steroids, and anticoagulants are added as adjuvants. Most patients treated with radiation therapy respond subjectively within 72 hours and show objective signs of relief within 7 days. The overall survival rate is dependent on the underlying malignancy. Nursing care focuses on the early detection of symptoms of SVCS and the emergency nature of the acute phase. Side effects of therapy and nursing care needs result from therapy as well as from the underlying disease. The psychosocial stressors on the patient and the family are an integral part of the nursing care. The goals of nursing management are good supportive care, astute assessment, and monitoring of the patient's condition. Finally, SVCS is a relative medical emergency.

To clarify this point, 26 patients suffering from dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT) were given a naming task, based on 60 black and white drawings, which allowed us to take into account several variables that might influence performance, notably word frequency, stimulus familiarity and prototypicality, name and image agreement and visual complexity. On a raw analysis, DAT patients as a group gave a lower performance with stimuli of Living Categories (LC) than with stimuli of Non-Living Categories (NLC), but when all the confounding factors were taken into account the category effect disappeared. Nevertheless, with a multiple single case approach, some patients presented a true dissociation: 11 were significantly better with Non-Living stimuli, and 3 with Living stimuli. In order to find what factors were involved in determining this distribution, we took the distribution of asymmetry indices of each patient, and plotted the individual category effect against the level of the general performance. In our sample, the distribution of asymmetry indices was skewed, and included a definite cluster of male subjects who were better at performing with Non-Living stimuli. Multivariate analysis suggested that the greater discrepancy shown by male patients was due to a protection acting on Non-Living stimuli rather than to a selective hampering of Living stimuli.

The relationship between social support satisfaction and social support network size was evaluated using the Social Support Questionnaire for 32 men and 44 women with a confirmed diagnosis of NIDDM. Control of diabetes, as measured by the glycosylated hemoglobin assay, was significantly correlated with social support satisfaction for women but negatively correlated with social support satisfaction for men.

For women, network size was significantly correlated with failure to attend sessions and with failure to complete a diary. For these women, network size was not significantly correlated with weight loss, which was the goal of the program. For men, network size was correlated with increases in weight, cholesterol, and triglycerides over an 18-month period. We conclude that social support network size and satisfaction have different functions for men and women faced with a serious chronic illness.

However, whether this hypothesis in CLBP holds is not clear. In this paper, possible mechanisms that contribute to the development of physical deconditioning in CLBP, such as avoidance behaviour and suppressive behaviour, are discussed. The presence of both deconditioning-related physiological changes, such as muscle atrophy, changes in metabolism, osteoporosis and obesity as well as deconditioning related functional changes, such as a decrease in cardiovascular capacity, a decrease in muscle strength and impaired motor control in patients with CLBP are discussed. Results of studies on the level of physical activities in daily life (PAL) and the level of physical fitness in patients with CLBP compared to healthy controls were reviewed. In studies on PAL results that were either lower or comparable to healthy subjects were found. The presence of disuse (i.e., a decrease in the level of physical activities in daily life) in patients with CLBP was not confirmed. The inconclusive findings in the papers reviewed may partly be explained by different measurement methods used in research on PAL in chronic pain. The level of physical fitness of CLBP patients also appeared to be lower or comparable to the fitness level of healthy persons. A discriminating factor between fit and unfit patients with back pain may be the fact that fit persons more frequently are still employed, and as such may be involved more in physical activity.

Mice were inoculated with two subclones of colon 26 adenocarcinoma, clone 20 (with a potent capacity to induce cachexia) and clone 5 (without such activity), and underwent splenectomy before or after tumor inoculation. Splenectomy significantly prolonged the survival of mice bearing clone 20 when it was performed prior to tumor inoculation, although the progression of cachexia and tumor growth were not affected. The survival rate was higher in splenectomized than it was in nonsplenectomized mice 20-40 days after tumor inoculation. Such effects on survival were not observed, however, in mice splenectomized after inoculation with clone 20 or in mice that underwent splenectomy either before or after inoculation with clone 5. The decrease of peripheral blood lymphocyte count observed in mice bearing clone 20 was magnified when splenectomy was performed before tumor inoculation, but the serum levels of tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-6 were comparable. These results indicate that cancer death from cachexia is not directly attributable to enhanced catabolism. The mechanism by which splenectomy ameliorates the survival of cachectic mice remains to be studied, although several changes observed in the splenectomized mice after inoculation, including decreases in the peripheral blood L3T4+ cells and Lyt-2+ cells on the 9th day and 15th day respectively, and increase in the L3T4+/Lyt-2+ cell ratio on the 15th day suggest the involvement of the modified host's immune response.",1995-Oct,"Adenocarcinoma/immunology*:mortality;Animals;Cachexia/immunology*;Clone Cells;Colonic Neoplasms/immunology*:mortality;Interleukin-6/blood;Leukocyte Count;Male;Mice;Mice, Inbred BALB C;Mice, Inbred DBA;Neoplasm Transplantation;Splenectomy*;Survival Analysis;T-Lymphocyte Subsets;Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/analysis","Comparative Study,Journal Article,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII","Interleukin-6,Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"

To examine this point, the role of fever and leukocytosis as diagnostic and prognostic indicators for surgical infections was evaluated. A prospective observational study was performed on all patients with suspected infection in 1997 on the general surgical services at a university hospital. Fever was defined as maximum temperature (Tmax) > or = 38.5 degrees C, and leukocytosis was defined as a white blood cell (WBC) count > or = 11,000/microl. Among all infections, patients presenting with a Tmax > or = 38.5 degrees C were younger (51.3 +/- 1.1 vs. 53.8 +/- 0.9 years, p = 0.005) and had a higher APACHE II score (15.1 +/- 0.5 vs. 11.4 +/- 0.4; p < 0.001). By logistic regression analysis chronic renal insufficiency was associated with a Tmax < 38.5 degrees C [odds ratio (OR) 0.371, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.195-0.704], and chronic steroid therapy was associated with a WBC count < 11,000/microl (OR 0.556, 95% CI 0.335-0.921).

This is used as an index of sympathetic activation. Similar increases in plasma NE levels are produced by intravenous glucose injections and these levels correlate positively with the amount of weight gained by adult rats when they are subsequently fed a diet enriched in calories, sucrose and fat (condensed milk (CM) diet) for three months. Thus, rats prone to develop diet induced obesity (DIO) on the CM diet have greater intravenous glucose induced NE responses than those which are diet resistant (DR). To test the hypothesis that this relationship is mediated by the brain, 17 chow fed, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were infused for 60 min with intracarotid glucose at 4 mg/kg/min and blood samples were obtained for plasma catecholamines, insulin and glucose. They were then placed on the CM diet for three months. After three months on the CM diet, there was a wide variability in body weight gain and the weights of retroperitoneal fat pads, an indirect measure of carcass adiposity. For all 17 rats, there was a significant correlation between both body weight gain (r = 0.685, P = 0.002) and retroperitoneal fat pad weights (r = 0.590, P = 0.013) with the levels of plasma NE reached 45-60 min into the preceding intracarotid glucose infusions.

However, in some clinical situations, the oral route is not feasible, and analgesic drugs consequently have to be administered via an alternative route.

      from idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). DESIGN: A retrospective study.
      PARTICIPANTS: Fifteen consecutive female patients with IIH associated with
      obesity were studied. INTERVENTION: Patients underwent weight loss and treatment 
      with acetazolamide during a 24-week period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The severity
      of papilledema was graded: absent (grade 0), mild (grade 1), moderate (grade 2), 
      and marked (grade 3), based on a predetermined grading system (""gold standard"")
      using stereoscopic photographs and the Frisen classification. RESULTS: The 15
      patients, with mean age of 31.3+/-8.8 years, had a mean weight of 110.5+/-28.7 kg
      and mean body mass index of 40.7+/-13.0 kg/m2. Eleven (73.3%) patients had
      improved papilledema during the 24-week study period, of which 10 (66.7%) had
      complete resolution of papilledema within a median time of 8.5 weeks. An average 
      of 3.3% weight loss (+/-0.5% standard error of the mean) was observed among
      patients having a one-grade change in papilledema. Weight loss of 6.2%+/-0.6%
      standard error of the mean was associated with a three-grade change in
      papilledema (i.e., complete resolution of marked papilledema). Nine of the ten
      patients with complete resolution of papilledema also took acetazolamide.
      However, none (26.7%) of the four patients without weight loss had improvement in
      papilledema despite similar treatment with acetazolamide. CONCLUSIONS:
      Approximately 6% weight loss was associated with resolution of marked papilledema
      in these authors' patients. The benefit of acetazolamide in IIH is questioned
      since weight loss, rather than acetazolamide, appeared to have been the catalyst

The pathologic process of PNBF seemed to stabilize some 6 to 8 months following trauma, and surgery after this period produced functional improvement in the 3 patients in whom it was tried. No satisfactory pathophysiological explanation has been found for the phenomenon of PNBR. Prolonged coma is common to all patients who suffered from PNBF and is probably an etiologic factor.

Simultaneously, the acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and inulin clearance rates were measured, and acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate reabsorption rates were calculated. Renal clearance of blood acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate remained constant. In contrast, acetoacetate reabsorption rate increased significantly from 47 plus or minus 10 mumoles/min on day 3 to 106 plus or minus 15, 89 plus or minus 10, and 96 plus or minus 10 mumoles/min on days 10, 17, and 24, respectively.

Both acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate reabsorption rates increased linearly when plotted against their filtered loads. Thus, no tubular maximal transport rate exists for acetoacetate or beta-hydroxybutyrate during physiologic ketonemia. Conservation 450-500 mmoles of ketone bodies/day prevents large urinary losses of cations during prolonged starvation.

Furthermore, stasis of stools containing these compounds is thought to induce damage to the intestinal mucosa. The prevention of CPT-11-induced side effects by oral alkalization (OA) combined with control of defecation (CD) was estimated in a case-control study of lung cancer patients. Coinciding with day 1 of CPT-11 infusion and for 4 days thereafter, OA and CD were practiced utilizing orally administered sodium bicarbonate, magnesium oxide, basic water and ursodeoxycholic acid. OA involved the daily use of all four therapeutics, and CD required doses of up to 4.0 g/day of magnesium oxide and 2 L/day of excess basic water. From three ongoing prospective phase I/II studies, we selected 37 consecutive patients who were treated with CPT-11 in combination with cisplatin in the presence of OA and CD (group B). Thirty-two control subjects who were matched to the background characteristics of the case patients were treated with the same regimen in the absence of OA and CD (group A). Toxicities induced by the CPT-11/cisplatin combination were evaluated and analyzed in group A and group B in a case-control format. The use of OA and CD resulted in significantly higher stool pH (p < 0.0001), while reducing the incidence of delayed diarrhea (> or = grade 2: group A 32.3% versus group B 9.4%; p = 0.005), nausea (p = 0.0001), vomiting (p = 0.001) and myelotoxicity, especially granulocytopenia (p = 0.03) and lymphocytopenia (p = 0.034). In addition, dose intensification was well tolerated in patients receiving OA and CD, allowing dose escalation from 35.6 +/- 6.0 to 39.9 +/- 5.6 mg/m(2)/week (p < 0.001). Tumor response rates for non-small cell lung cancer were 59.3% (16/27 patients) in group B compared with 38.5% (10/26 patients) in group A. Multivariate analysis revealed that the risk of CPT-11-induced delayed diarrhea greater than grade 2 was associated with OA and CD (odds ratio for delayed diarrhea, 0.14 with use of OA and CD; 95% confidence interval, 0.05 to 0.4; p = 0.0002) and age (odds ratio, 1.08 per increase in age; 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.15; p = 0.009).

Control women, identified through random digit dialing, were individually matched to cases by year of pregnancy, age at pregnancy, and geographical proximity of residence. Choriocarcinoma risk was decreased significantly as body mass index increased (P for trend = 0.03). Cases reported low-calorie dieting significantly less frequently than controls [odds ratio estimate (OR) = 0.50, P = 0.05] and were significantly less likely to participate in regular exercise (OR = 0.38, P = 0.004). Compared to women with a heavy menstrual flow, those with light menstruation had significantly elevated risk (OR = 6.69, P = 0.01). Menarche after age 12 was also associated with elevated risk of this disease (OR = 2.89, P = 0.003). There were significantly more pairs of dizygotic twins born to cases and their first degree relatives than to controls (12 case families with 13 sets of twins versus 3 sets in control families, OR = 6.36, P = 0.009).

Vernier thresholds were measured using both a classical single step position change and also a grating that was position-modulated sinusoidally along its entire length. For both types of target amblyopes exhibited deficient displacement sensitivity although accurate fixation was not strictly required. The vernier deficits were not critically dependent upon the type of displacement used, and the magnitudes of the vernier and contrast sensitivity deficits were closely related. Both were largest at high spatial frequencies, and those amblyopes with larger contrast sensitivity deficits also had larger vernier acuity deficiencies. Typically, contrast sensitivity and vernier acuity were normal, or nearly so, at very low spatial frequencies.

Myoclonus was induced by the 5-HT precursor L-5-hydroxytryptophan (L-5-HTP) and the non-selective 5-HT1A/1B/5-HT2 receptor agonist 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyl-tryptamine (5-MeODMT). The selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY100635 (N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl)cycloh exanecarboxamide trihydrochloride) inhibited both head and whole-body jerking.

However, the effective force developed by this upper airway (UA) dilator muscle depends on its metabolic and histochemical characteristics. The aim of this study was to compare the metabolic and fiber type characteristics of two UA dilator muscles, musculus uvulae (MU) and GG, in 17 patients with SAHS and in 11 nonapneic snorers. MU and GG samples were obtained during uvulopalatopharyngoplasty. Anthropomorphic characteristics were similar in snorers and patients with SAHS, who differed only in the presence of sleep-related breathing abnormalities. MU glycolytic, glycogenolytic, and anaerobic enzyme activities were significantly greater in patients with SAHS than in snorers. These differences were not observed for GG. MU and GG enzyme activities differed only in snorers. The proportion of type I muscle fiber was greater in GG than in MU, but it was similar in patients with SAHS and snorers for each muscle. Type IIA and IIB muscle fibers were, respectively, in greater and smaller proportions in patients with SAHS than in snorers.

The degree of microleakage at the A-I interface of 5 implant systems was comparatively assessed at varying closing torques. Using colored tracing probes driven by a 2-atm pressure system, the interface microleakage of Br？nemark, Sulzer Calcitek, 3i, ITI, and Steri-Oss implants was determined spectrophotometrically. Microleakage through the A-I interface occurred in all systems, with variability between systems, samples, and closing torques. As closing torque increased from 10 Ncm to 20 Ncm to manufacturers' recommended closing torques, microleakage decreased significantly (P < .005) for all systems. Analysis of variance showed significant interaction between closing torques and the time course of microleakage, and between systems and the time course of microleakage (P < .001). The results indicate that fluids and small molecules are capable of passing through the interface of all the A-I assemblies studied.

ZT's reading displays the characteristics of the deep dyslexia syndrome in both languages, that is, production of semantic, visual, and morphological errors, and concreteness effect in reading aloud and impossibility of reading nonwords. In the first part of this paper, using a three-route model of reading, we account for the patient's performance by positing functional lesions, which affect the non-lexical, the semantic lexical and the non-semantic lexical routes of reading. Phonological priming observed in a cross-language visual lexical decision task indicates that implicit assembled phonological recoding is possible. The above lesions and implicit nonword reading characterize the output form of deep dyslexia. However, error distribution reveals dissociations across languages (e.g. the semantic error rate is higher in French whereas translations are more frequent in the Arabic testing) that cannot be accounted for within a three-route model. In the second part, extensions to Plaut and Shallice's connectionist model (Cognitive Neuropsychology, 10 (5) (1993) 377) are proposed to account for the translinguistic errors observed. ZT's error distribution is compared to that obtained by Plaut and Shallice after lesions had been applied at different locations through the 40-60 network. The overall syndrome of deep dyslexia found in both languages is explained as resulting from lesions along the direct (O-->I) and output (S-->Ip, Ip-->P) pathways of reading. Lesions along the output pathway mostly affecting S-->Ip connections in French and Ip-->P connections in Arabic account for discrepancies in ZT's error pattern across tasks and languages.

In glycodeoxycholic acid-induced hemorrhagic-necrotizing pancreatitis AAG was without effect on parameters measured (plasma amylase, plasma lipase activity, histological scores) at 1800 or 4200 mg/kg i.v. At the extremely high dose of 1500 mg/kg i.v. plasma amylase and lipase levels were decreased. In lipopolysaccharide-mediated ARDS, AAG was tested at 50, 200 or 600 mg/kg i.v. AAG, but also the placebo formulation decreased the myeloperoxidase content in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Histological alterations were improved by AAG, however, not by the placebo formulation.

Rats were studied for 17 weeks. Serum and erythrocyte Mg2+ and Ca2+ (measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy) and Na+ and K+ (measured by flame photometry) were determined every 3 or 4 weeks. From 13 weeks of age, blood pressure (BP) was significantly elevated in SHR compared with age-matched WKY. BP was reduced (P < .01) in SHR after 10 weeks of Mg2+ supplementation and at 27 weeks of age, BP in SHR was 218 (12 mm Hg v 184 +/- 9 mm Hg) in Mg-SHR. From 18 weeks of age, serum and intracellular Mg2+ levels were significantly lower (P < .05) and from 21 weeks of age, erythrocyte Ca2+ was significantly higher in SHR than in WKY.

Those that have a fundamental similarity characterized by the appearance of exaggerated velocity-dependent resistance to the lengthening of skeletal muscles are called spasticity. Reports based on clinical observations of motor disorders have and continue to provide the essential database of information regarding the range and distribution of unifying and discordant features of spasticity. Laboratory investigations employing animal models of motor disorders following experimental lesions of the central nervous system have reproduced some of the neurophysiologic changes that accompany injury of the central nervous system in humans. Those experimental lesions produced by spinal cord contusion/compression reproduce many of the histopathologic features displayed in traumatic injury of the human spinal cord as well. Studies using this model have revealed not only changes in reflex threshold and amplitude but also alterations in fundamental rate-modulation processes that regulate reflex excitability during repetitive stimulation.

To investigate the association between the LPL gene and low HDL-C levels, we studied two polymorphisms (Hind III and Pvu II) and three mutations (Asn291Ser, Gly188Glu and LPL(Arita)) of the LPL gene in 114 children with low HDL-C levels (<40 mg/dl) and 194 control children using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) techniques (PCR-RFLP). The frequency of the Pvu II +/+ genotype was significantly higher in the children with low-HDL/high-TG (TG>100 mg/dl, 90th percentile level among Japanese schoolchildren) than in the other children (vs the low-HDL/normal-TG children, chi2 = 7.49, p < 0.01; vs control children, chi2 = 7.23, p < 0.01). Pvu II+ allele of the LPL gene was associated with elevated TG levels in low HDL-C groups. In addition, we found one heterozygote of LPL(Arita) (deletion of G at base 916 in exon 5, the most common mutation of LPL deficiency in Japanese), among the low-HDL/high-TG subjects. The other two variants were not detected in either the low-HDL children or control children. LPL Asn291Ser and Gly188Glu have been presumed to be rare in the Japanese population.

The statistical analysis (analysis of variance for repeated measures) contrasted the results obtained from the nonaffected side with those from the affected side over the 3 months studied. At the 45 degree angle, which better exposes the articular configuration of the shoulder, the difference in the V angle between the affected and nonaffected shoulders was significant for the subluxed group (p less than 0.01), indicating that such a V-shaped space can be identified. The measures taken also indicate that a downward subluxation of the humeral head occurs relative to the scapula without any systematic abduction of the humerus or downward rotation of the scapula.

METHODS:One hundred fourteen patients (62 male) and 73 healthy subjects (38 male) 5 to 20 years of age were analyzed for growth data and current auxology, stage of puberty, and bone age.RESULTS:Boys with hydrocephalus were shorter than control boys during their first 8 years of age, and no catch-up growth was observed until puberty. Girls with hydrocephalus were of the same size at birth as the control girls, but their linear growth retarded during the first years of life, leading to reduced relative height between the age of 5 to 8 years. The pubertal growth spurt occurred earlier in boys with hydrocephalus (age at midgrowth spurt, 12.1 vs 13.3 years), and a similar trend was seen in girls (10.0 vs 10.7 years). The final height was again reduced, especially in boys. Patients with hydrocephalus were more obese than control subjects, girls more often than boys. Relative bone age was retarded in prepubertal (-0.42 vs 0.32 SD) and accelerated in pubertal patients (0.54 vs -0.19 SD).
CONCLUSIONS:Children with hydrocephalus experience slow linear growth in prepuberty, but they have an earlier adolescent growth spurt. Together these factors result in a reduced final height. An increase in relative weight emerges in the preadolescent period, and this phenomenon is accentuated after puberty, leading to an increased prevalence of obesity.",1995-Jun,"Adolescent;Adult;Body Height;Body Weight;Case-Control Studies;Cerebrospinal Fluid Shunts;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Growth*;Head/anatomy & histology;Humans;Hydrocephalus/complications:physiopathology*:therapy;Male;Obesity/complications;Puberty/physiology*;Spinal Dysraphism/complications:physiopathology","Journal Article,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Pediatrics,

There is also some evidence that habitual snoring alone, even without OSA, can do the same. Many of the hitherto unexplained epidemiological, clinical, biochemical, hematological, and physiological abnormalities seen in essential hypertension (EH) could be explained by the accompanying sleep related breathing disorders (SRBD). Many cases of resistant hypertension are probably due to SRBD. Recent studies show that SRBD are extremely common in EH but that the vast majority of patients with these sleep disorders are being missed by physicians who are treating the accompanying hypertension, even when the patients already have blatant symptoms of OSA. Recent investigations have shown that the probable reason for this underdiagnosis of OSA is lack of physician knowledge about the condition. This lack of knowledge is prevalent not only among family physicians, but among hypertension specialists and researchers in the field of hypertension as well. OSA is a common, easily diagnosed, and eminently treatable condition that is associated not only with disturbed sleep, loud snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness (which greatly increases the risk of traffic accidents), but also with hypertension, especially resistant hypertension, a broad range of cardiovascular problems, decreased sexual functioning, memory deficits, difficulty concentrating, and changes in personality and mood.

In coronary artery disease (CAD), the release of different cytokines activates cellular defense. Infiltration of neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages is detected in the vessel wall in patients with CAD. Macrophages activated by interferon gamma synthesize metalloproteinases and neopterin, a pteridin derivative that has been used as an immune marker. To determine neopterin levels in patients with chronic CAD and acute coronary syndromes, the authors studied 116 subjects: 1) 25 consecutive patients (18 men, 7 women; mean age 68.5 +/- 14.3, range 40 to 86 years) with unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction (AMI); 2) 31 consecutive patients (25 men, 6 women; mean age 64 +/- 12.7, range 47 to 83 years) with signs and symptoms of clinically stable CAD; and 3) 60 consecutive healthy blood donors (38 men, 22 women; mean age 54.4 +/- 6.23, range 44 to 66 years). Neopterin levels were determined with a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. In patients with unstable angina and AMI before thrombolytic therapy, neopterin levels were not significantly different from levels in patients with stable CAD (5.97 +/- 1.4 versus 7.84 +/- 3.56 nmol/L; P = 0.15). Neopterin levels in both patient groups did not significantly differ from levels in control subjects (P > 0.1). Neopterin levels in patients with unstable angina and AMI were measured four times during a 72-hour period. The lowest value was observed at baseline and differed significantly from values after 72 hours (P < 0.001; 5.97 +/- 1.4 versus 9.25 +/- 2.36). Neopterin levels after 72 hours were also significantly different from initial values in patients with stable CAD (P < 0.001). There was no correlation between neopterin and creatine kinase (CK) levels, CK-MB isoenzyme, or troponin I as markers for the extent of the myocardial injury during the observation period. These data do not support previous reports of higher baseline levels of serum neopterin in patients with unstable angina or AMI compared with patients with chronic, stable CAD and healthy controls. Neopterin as a marker of macrophage activation is significantly increased in patients with AMI and unstable angina shortly after the onset of symptoms (after a period of 72 hours), supporting the hypothesis of monocyte and macrophage activation in patients with an acute coronary syndrome or AMI.",,"Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Angina, Unstable/blood:complications;Austria/epidemiology;Biological Markers/blood;Coronary Artery Disease/blood*:complications;Creatine Kinase/blood;Creatine Kinase, MB Form;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Isoenzymes/blood;Male;Middle Aged;Myocardial Infarction/blood:complications;Neopterin/blood*;Time Factors;Troponin I/blood","Comparative Study,Journal Article","Heart disease (Hagerstown, Md.)","Biological Markers,Isoenzymes,Troponin I,Neopterin,Creatine Kinase,Creatine Kinase, MB Form"

Within the 5' flanking region, six frequent sequence variants were detected (q > 0.10), and the allele frequencies of three of these variants differed between obese and average weight Caucasian women (+19, chi 2 = 4.46, p = 0.035; -1823, chi 2 = 4.36, p = 0.037; -2548, chi 2 = 5.73, p = 0.017). Nine infrequent sequence variants were detected (q < 0.05) but they did not occur more often among obese women compared with those of average-weight. For extremely obese women, three polymorphisms (+19, -188, and -633) predicted the degree of obesity. Allelic variants may influence the regulation of the leptin gene and thereby influence body weight, particularly among extremely obese women. However, given the low variability in coding regions and the high variability in the 5' flanking region, discerning the functional significance of each variant is likely to be difficult.",1999-May,"Adolescent;Adult;African Continental Ancestry Group/genetics;Aged;Alleles;Body Mass Index;Codon/genetics;DNA/chemistry:genetics;DNA Mutational Analysis;European Continental Ancestry Group/genetics;Female;Gene Frequency;Genetic Variation;Genotype;Humans;Leptin/genetics*;Linkage Disequilibrium;Middle Aged;Obesity/genetics*;Phenotype;Point Mutation;Polymorphism, Genetic;Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational;Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid/genetics*","Journal Article,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",Annals of human genetics,"Codon,Leptin,DNA"

Therefore, we studied clinical and echocardiographic characteristics of 2709 American Indians participating in the Strong Heart Study without symptomatic atherosclerosis. The study sample was divided into tertiles of fibrinogen (cut-points, 3.24 and 3.83 g/L). Mean age, body mass index, proportion of women, and prevalences of hypertension and diabetes increased from the first to third tertile of fibrinogen. After adjustment for covariates, systolic and pulse pressures did not significantly differ among tertiles of fibrinogen, whereas diastolic pressure was slightly lower in the third than in lower tertiles of fibrinogen. HDL cholesterol was lower and plasma creatinine and urinary albumin/creatinine ratio was higher in the third tertile of fibrinogen. Left ventricular mass index, pulse pressure/stroke index, an estimate of arterial stiffness, and cardiac index were higher and left ventricular systolic function and total peripheral resistance were lower in the third than in two lower tertiles of fibrinogen independent of major covariates. In multiple regression analyses, left ventricular mass and pulse pressure/stroke index were positively associated with, and stress-corrected midwall shortening negatively associated with fibrinogen, independent of major covariates. Participants with fibrinogen >3.83 g/L were more likely to have at least 1 preclinical cardiovascular abnormality such as left ventricular hypertrophy, elevated arterial stiffness, or systolic myocardial dysfunction independent of covariates including renal dysfunction (adjusted odds ratio, 1.38; P<0.001).

Struggling with meal-related situations: experiences among persons with COPD.,"Reduced nutritional intake with low and decreased body weight can be a component of normal ageing. There is, however, also a greater risk for reduced nutritional intake within certain diagnoses, especially for chronic diseases. Malnutrition in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is caused by many factors. The relationship between COPD and low values of body mass index (BMI) is a known independent risk for mortality. For optimal support and care with special focus on nutritional status and interventions, caregivers need more knowledge about the meal-related situations (i.e. shopping for food, cooking and eating) of COPD patients. The aim of this study was to describe experiences of meal-related situations as viewed from the individual's perspective. The sample included eight women and five men with COPD recruited from five primary health clinics. The participants' average age was 68.9 years, with values of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1) percentage) ranging from 18 to 69 and BMI values from 15 to 40. A descriptive design with qualitative interviews and self-reported diaries were used and the data were later analysed using content analysis. Findings showed consistency between informants' COPD, nutritional status and descriptions of experiences in meal-related situations. Findings were disease-specific but were also found to be general- and age-related. Respondents described physical influences and positive and negative feelings in their meal-related situations. Feelings of dependence, level of activity, transport of food, having company or being alone, appetite, hunger and need of time were also mentioned. Most research reports reduced nutritional status from a medical perspective. To our knowledge, no study has reported the positive and negative feelings that arise when eating in persons with COPD. Malnutrition for persons with COPD is not only caused by eating difficulties: eating is an integral part of social situations as shown in this study.",2005-Sep,"Activities of Daily Living;Adaptation, Psychological*;Aged;Appetite;Attitude to Health*;Body Mass Index;Cooking;Diet Records;Disease Progression;Fatigue/etiology;Feeding Behavior/psychology*;Female;Forced Expiratory Volume;Humans;Hunger;Male;Malnutrition/etiology:prevention & control*:psychology*;Nursing Methodology Research;Nutritional Status;Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive/complications*;Qualitative Research;Questionnaires;Risk Factors;Self Care/psychology;Time Management/psychology",Journal Article,Scandinavian journal of caring sciences,

Although each of the children experienced a period of disturbed language processing in the initial stages postonset, at the time of testing none of the children were considered to be clinically aphasic. Yet, on a standardized test of oral reading each of the children achieved a reading age that lagged behind chronological age and marked reading impairments were disclosed in four of the five children. A set of standardized and nonstandardized tests, aimed at measuring aspects of cognitive and spoken language processing that are considered to be important for normal reading acquisition, was administered. Where nonstandardized tests were used, performance of each of the stroke children was compared to that of groups of normally developing control children, closely matched for chronological age. A range of residual deficits in cognitive and spoken language processing was disclosed among the five brain-damaged children that appeared to be associated with their reading impairments. Two children had expectedly poor reading due to a selective impairment in verbal IQ; a specific phonological reading disorder was revealed in two children, each of which had a residual impairment to phonological awareness; and delayed reading acquisition was observed in one child with a general language deficit. It is suggested that when a child suffers damage to the left hemisphere in the early stages of reading acquisition, difficulties with learning to read are likely to ensue and may arise as a consequence of an underlying cognitive or linguistic deficit.",2000-Apr,"Brain/physiopathology;Child;Child, Preschool;Cognition Disorders/diagnosis:etiology;Dyslexia, Acquired/diagnosis*:etiology;Female;Functional Laterality/physiology;Humans;Intelligence;Language Disorders/diagnosis*;Male;Stroke/complications:physiopathology","Case Reports,Journal Article,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Brain and language,

Twenty-five patients (36%) had deep or circumferential pain in the thigh. Of the 44 who were most active at 5 years those with thigh pain had less proximal cortical loss than those without (p < 0.05), most cortical bone formation distally and most often had incomplete radiolucent lines at the mid-stem level, perhaps indicating more elastic displacement of the bone relative to the prosthesis. The presence of radiolucent lines correlated with the increase in cortical width at 5 years (p < 0.01). Cortical remodelling continued after 5 years at all levels except at the tip (p < 0.01).

Maximal inspiratory pressure (PI(max)) proved sensitive in predicting nocturnal O(2) saturation. However, PI(max) is highly dependent on patient collaboration; on the other hand Mouth Occlusion Pressure (MOP) is a reliable, non-volitional parameter index of central respiratory drive. Since exercise testing (ET) is also part of the assessment of ventilatory regulation the authors aimed to determine whether MOP and ET are sensitive and reliable parameters predictive of nocturnal O(2) saturation and clinical evolution. We conducted a Polysomnographic (PSG) study in two groups of 14 patients, selected according to their MOP level. Patients performed at admission an ET, Respiratory Function tests (RFT) and clinical evaluation with Norris spinal and bulbar scores (SNS and BNS). All patients in Group I (Low MOP) had decreased O(2) saturation during ET (P<0.001).

In addition, 43 of the 54 patients had one or more stenoses with multiple channels (recanalisation).

Forty four per cent of plaques causing stenosis between 30% and 50% by diameter were eccentric and retained a considerable arc of normal media. These lesions were often in series with segments of higher grade stenosis that did not have an arc of normal media. The overall frequency of plaque types gave no indication of the proportions of different plaque types within an individual. In 15% of patients all the plaques causing greater than 50% diameter stenosis were fibrous and in 13% of patients all the plaques were of the lipid type.

Ten days postoperatively, VMH-lesioned rats had high plasma levels of urea and low plasma tyrosine, while plasma alanine, glutamine, total amino acid, and protein levels were unaltered. Urea production and excretion were increased in VMH-lesioned rats. Increased urea synthesis could not be attributed to enhanced peripheral release of amino acids. In vitro, measurements of hepatic amino acid uptake and liver protein synthesis did not reveal any disturbances of these processes in VMH-lesioned rats. However, hepatic transamination and lipogenesis from amino acids were increased following VMH-lesions. In addition to the hyperinsulinemia previously reported to occur in nonhyperphagic VMH-lesioned rats, this study showed an increased glucagon secretion from perfused pancreases of these animals. These data together suggest that the excess of the two hormones at the portal vein of VMH-lesioned rats would favor uptake and deamination of amino acids, their diversion to lipid synthesis and possibly other pathways, with consequent increase in urea production and reduced supply of amino acids to peripheral tissues available for nitrogen retention.",1980-Jan,"Amino Acids/metabolism;Animals;Female;Glucagon/secretion;Hyperinsulinism/metabolism*;Hypothalamus/physiology*;Hypothalamus, Middle/physiology*;Lipid Metabolism;Liver/metabolism*;Nitrogen/metabolism*;Obesity/metabolism*;Pancreas/secretion;Protein Biosynthesis;Rats;Urea/metabolism",Journal Article,The American journal of physiology,"Amino Acids,Urea,Nitrogen,Glucagon"

Our findings showed that signaling pathways leading to I kappa B kinase beta (IKK beta) and NF-kappa B are activated in insulin-responsive tissues of obese and high-fat-fed animals. Since activation correlates with the development of insulin resistance, we asked whether signaling through this might be involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. Heterozygous gene deletion (Ikk beta+/-) or salicylates, working as IKK beta inhibitors, improved insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant rodent models. Furthermore, high doses of salicylates (aspirin or salicylate) improved insulin sensitivity in patients with type II diabetes.

These regions include primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, anterior cingulate cortex, insular cortex, and regions of the frontal cortex. Nevertheless, the role of different cortical areas in pain processing is controversial, particularly that of primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Human brain-imaging studies do not consistently reveal pain-related activation of S1, and older studies of cortical lesions and cortical stimulation in humans did not uncover a clear role of S1 in the pain experience. Whereas studies from a number of laboratories show that S1 is activated during the presentation of noxious stimuli as well as in association with some pathological pain states, others do not report such activation. Several factors may contribute to the different results among studies. First, we have evidence demonstrating that S1 activation is highly modulated by cognitive factors that alter pain perception, including attention and previous experience. Second, the precise somatotopic organization of S1 may lead to small focal activations, which are degraded by sulcal anatomical variability when averaging data across subjects. Third, the probable mixed excitatory and inhibitory effects of nociceptive input to S1 could be disparately represented in different experimental paradigms. Finally, statistical considerations are important in interpreting negative findings in S1. We conclude that, when these factors are taken into account, the bulk of the evidence now strongly supports a prominent and highly modulated role for S1 cortex in the sensory aspects of pain, including localization and discrimination of pain intensity.",1999-Jul-6,"Brain Mapping;Humans;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Pain/physiopathology*;Perception/physiology*;Somatosensory Cortex/physiology:physiopathology*:radionuclide imaging;Tomography, Emission-Computed","Journal Article,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Review",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,

855,856.0,11200981.0,Shy-Drager Syndrome,Syncope,None,0,0,Orthostatic stress is necessary to maintain the dynamic range of cardiovascular control in space.,"In the upright position, gravity fills the low-pressure systems of human circulation with blood and interstitial fluid in the sections below the diaphragm. Without gravity one pressure component in the vessels disappears and the relationship between hydrostatic pressure and oncotic pressure, which regulates fluid passage across the capillary endothelium in the terminal vascular bed, shifts constantly. The visible consequences of this are a puffy face and ""bird"" legs. The plasma volume shrinks in space and the range of cardiovascular control is reduced. When they stand up for the first time after landing, 30-50% of astronauts suffer from orthostatic intolerance. It remains unclear whether microgravity impairs cardiovascular reflexes, or whether it is the altered volume status that causes the cardiovascular instability following space flight. Lower body negative pressure was used in several space missions to stimulate the cardiovascular reflexes before, during and after a space flight. The results show that cardiovascular reflexes are maintained in microgravity. However, the astronauts' volume status changed in space, towards a volume-retracted state, as measurements of fluid-regulating hormones have shown. It can be hypothesized that the control of circulation and body fluid homeostasis in humans is adapted to their upright posture in the Earth's gravitational field. Autonomic control regulates fluid distribution to maintain the blood pressure in that posture, which most of us have to cope with for two-thirds of the day. A determined amount of interstitial volume is necessary to maintain the dynamic range of cardiovascular control in the upright posture; otherwise orthostatic intolerance may occur more often.",2000,"Adult;Body Fluids/physiology;Cardiovascular Physiological Phenomena*;Heart/physiology;Hormones/physiology;Humans;Lower Body Negative Pressure;Male;Plasma Volume/physiology;Posture/physiology;Shy-Drager Syndrome/physiopathology*;Space Flight*;Stress, Physiological/physiopathology*;Sympathetic Nervous System/physiology;Syncope/physiopathology;Ventricular Function, Left/physiology;Water;Water Loss, Insensible/physiology",Journal Article,Pfl¨¹gers Archiv : European journal of physiology,"Hormones,Water"

Logistic regression showed microalbuminuria to be an independent predictor of mortality, not influenced by age, duration of diabetes, blood pressure, glycosylated haemoglobin or creatinine at the initial examination. Eight years later, in the group with initial microalbuminuria, eight still had microalbuminuria and five patients had developed nephropathy. In the group without albuminuria in 1984, only one patient had progressed to microalbuminuria and no patients to nephropathy.

Increased sleep length in fall/winter is not unique to SAD. Among 1571 individuals across four latitudes surveyed at random from the general population, winter sleep increases of < or = 2 hr/day relative to summer were reported by nearly half. However, hypersomnia had a low correlation (r = 0.29) with the total number of other SAD symptoms that were reported in this sample. Ten SAD patients kept daily sleep logs across 1 yr that showed increases in fall and winter (sleeping most in October; least in May) whose maximum averaged 2.7 hr per day more weekend sleep than in spring and summer. These winter increases might have been somewhat attenuated since most received light therapy during part of the winter.

The lethal nature of ricinine-induced seizures is considered to be a good model for the study of the events that cause death during clonic seizures, particularly those related to respiratory spasms. The initial signs (pre-seizure period) were marked by exophthalmus and decreased locomotor behavior. Animals killed during the preseizure period presented an increased utilization rate (HVA/DA) of dopamine (DA), an increased concentration of noradrenaline (NA), and a decreased concentration of glutamate (Glu), glutamine (Gln), taurine (Tau), and serotonin (5-HT) in the cerebral cortex. The seizure period is characterized by the occurrence of hind limb myoclonus and respiratory spasms, which are followed by death. Alterations in the cerebral cortex concentration of these neurotransmitters persisted during the seizure period. These alterations are only partially observed in the hippocampus, mainly during the seizure period.

Apart from the hematologic abnormality, the other universal clinical finding is mild to moderate mental handicap; there is also a broad spectrum of associated dysmorphic features. Initial analysis of the alpha globin gene complex (which maps to chromosome band 16p13.3), demonstrated that the alpha thalassemia results from failure of the patient to inherit an alpha globin allele from one of the parents. Using a combined molecular and cytogenetic approach, we have extended this analysis to show that all of these patients have 16p deletions which are variable in extent but limited to the terminal band 16p13.3; in at least four cases the deletion results from unbalanced chromosome translocation, and hence aneuploidy of a second chromosome is also present.

What they lack is proper information and motivation to timely cope with those causes as well as to ask for the aid of the stomatologist when necessary. According to the parents, the most important is the role of the stomatologist and the mass media for their information.

Even effective anti-viral or bacterial agents often fail to eliminate or inhibit the infection, as these drugs may also fail to reach the most painful area where often unrecognizable circulatory disturbances co-exist. Using the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test Molecular Identification Method, we were able to localize substance P and thromboxane B2 (a good indicator of the presence and degree of circulatory disturbances) in the painful area along with virus or bacteria. Based on the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test localization method for specific substances or microbes, the author has successfully treated cases of chronic intractable pain by the combination of anti-viral or bacterial agents with either manual acupuncture, electro-acupuncture or transcutaneous electrical stimulation through a pair of surface electrodes. Among a variety of infections, the most common cause of severe intractable pain was herpes simplex virus, and the most common bacterial cause of intractable pain of moderate degree was campylobacter. In addition, chlamydia was a very common cause of mild intractable pain. When peripheral nerve fibers are hypersensitive from nerve injury due to viral infection, in addition to the drug therapy for infection, use of Vitamin B1 25 mg., 2 times a day for an average adult often accelerates recovery time. As an anti-viral agent for the herpes virus family, the author found that EPA (Omega 3 fish oil, Eicosa Pentaenoic Acid, C20:5 omega 3), at doses between 180 mg. and 350 mg (depending upon body weight) 4 times a day for 2 to 6 weeks, without prescribing the common anti-viral agent Acyclovir, often eliminated the symptoms due to viral infection including all well-known types of the herpes virus, such as herpes simplex virus, Epstein-Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus. Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus are usually not associated with intractable severe pain, but they are often associated with a recurrent burning or itching sensation and they can cause intractable frequent muscle twitching. Viruses belonging to the herpes family almost always exist between the midline of one side of the spinal cord and the midline of the front of the body where these nerves from the spinal cord end and the same virus is localized only on one side of the body at the same spinal level.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",1990,"Acupuncture Therapy/methods*;Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use*;Bacterial Infections/complications:diagnosis:physiopathology*;Diagnosis, Differential;Humans;Medicine, Chinese Traditional;Pain, Intractable/diagnosis:etiology:therapy*;Thromboxane B2/diagnostic use*;Virus Diseases/complications:diagnosis:physiopathology*",Journal Article,Acupuncture & electro-therapeutics research,"Anti-Bacterial Agents,Thromboxane B2"

For patients with early stages of Parkinson's disease (PD) the discriminative power of amplitude was compared with that of other time domain characteristics of tremor recordings that are probably not evident clinically. Postural tremor with and without visual feedback and rest tremor were recorded in both hands of a group of patients with Parkinson's disease (n = 21) and a group of healthy control subjects (n = 30) using displacement lasers. Velocity and acceleration data were derived from displacement data. Twelve time domain characteristics were calculated on each recording and the discriminating power of each was evaluated using the worse hand in each case. Postural tremor with no visual feedback separates the two groups of subjects most efficiently, especially in velocity and acceleration. Tremor in Parkinson's disease (in comparison to normal physiologic tremor) has a specific morphology, has a distinctive histogram, is more periodic, and contains indications of nonlinearity in the underlying dynamics. There may also be greater difference in amplitude between the two hands and time asymmetry in tremor of patients with PD. A series of finger flexions seems to enhance normal tremor but not tremor in PD and may thus aid in discrimination. Discrimination of tremor attributable to PD from normal physiologic tremor can be enhanced by measuring time domain characteristics subtler than amplitude, particularly when amplitude itself is not large.

In humans and experimental animals, we have shown that interstitial disease is accompanied by up-regulation of complement components in tubular epithelial cells. Glomerulonephritis was induced in mice by the intraperitoneal injection of horse spleen apoferritin (HSA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In addition to wild-type C57/B6 mice, animals in which the C5a receptor had been deleted (C5aR KO) were used. Animals were killed after 3 or 6 weeks, and kidneys harvested. At three weeks, both groups had evidence of mild mesangial matrix expansion and increased cellularity; there were no crescents, sclerotic lesions, or interstitial disease. At six weeks, glomerular lesions were advanced, but identical in the two groups. Both groups had evidence of an identical pattern of C3 gene expression in the tubular epithelium by in situ hybridization. There was a marked difference, however, in the extent of interstitial injury. Wild-type animals had significantly greater numbers of infiltrating interstitial cells, greater expansion of the peritubular space, more tubular atrophy, and more apoptotic tubular cells than did C5aR KOs. The anaphylotoxic fragment of C5, C5a, is not likely to be important in the glomerular component of this model of progressive glomerulonephritis. On the other hand, the interstitial component is markedly attenuated in knockout animals. These data support a role for complement in the interstitial component of this glomerulonephritis model.

Since this model is unilateral, it is possible to examine relative changes in the density of TH-positive staining of the striatum at the population level within the same section.

There is also an increase in the relative density of staining in the nucleus accumbens, in the absence of shrinkage of that nucleus. There is no relationship between the degree of density increase in the striatum, and its degree of shrinkage.

Epileptiform activation can regulate the expression of neurotrophins, and increases or decreases in neurotrophins can affect both epileptogenesis and seizure-related axonal growth. Interestingly, the expression of nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor is rapidly up-regulated following seizures, while NT-3 mRNA remains unchanged or undergoes a delayed down-regulation, suggesting that NT-3 might have a different function in epileptogenesis. In the present study, we demonstrate that continuous intraventricular infusion of NT-3 in the absence of kindling triggers mossy fiber sprouting in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and the stratum oriens of the CA3 region. Furthermore, despite this NT-3-related sprouting effect, continuous infusion of NT-3 retards the development of behavioral seizures and inhibits kindling-induced mossy fiber sprouting in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. We also show that prolonged infusion of NT-3 leads to a decrease in kindling-induced Trk phosphorylation and a down-regulation of the high-affinity Trk receptors, TrkA and TrkC, suggesting an involvement of both cholinergic nerve growth factor receptors and hippocampal NT-3 receptors in these effects.

It involves the induction of a seizure for therapeutic purposes by the administration of a variable-frequency electrical stimulus via electrodes applied to the scalp. The original application of ECT in non-anaesthetised patients resulted in many traumatic effects and was replaced, in the early 1960s, with a modified ECT regimen that used anaesthesia with neuromuscular blockade. This remains the worldwide standard today. The development of modern ECT devices, with improved impulse modes, has also reduced the incidence of post-interventional cognitive adverse effects. The variety of centrally-acting co-medications administered and the cardiovascular effects occurring during the procedure make patients receiving ECT a challenge for the anaesthetist. The efficacy of ECT depends on the production of adequate seizures; however, the anaesthetic agents commonly used during ECT suppress the generation of convulsions. Therefore, the efficacy of ECT requires knowledge of anaesthetic precepts, understanding of the interaction between anaesthetic drugs and seizure activity, and awareness of the physiological effects of ECT as well as the treatment of those effects. Successful and safe ECT depends on the correct choice of anaesthetic drugs for the individual patient, which have to be chosen with respect to the individual concomitant medication and pre-existing diseases.

The effects of different stimulus current intensity, frequency and pulse duration were also examined. It was found that for both DRS and PES at pulse frequency of 10 Hz and current amplitude of 10 microA are the optimal parameters to modulate both the spontaneous and the noxious evoked responses. These stimuli produced prolonged effects related to the duration of stimulation. The external (PES) low current stimulation which was delivered below the sensory threshold was as effective in modulating noxious responses as the invasive DRS in intact animals and in animals with bilateral dorsolateral-funiculus ablation.

However, this association remains controversial. We investigated the relationships between the beta(2)-AR gene variant (Gln27Glu) and obesity, insulin resistance, and serum lipids in Japanese-Americans. The frequency of an abnormal Gln27Glu allele in the beta(2)-AR gene in 652 subjects was 0.092 in males, 0.077 in females, and 0.084 overall, markedly lower than the previously reported value of 0.4 in Caucasian men and women. In both males and females, there were no differences in the indices of obesity, insulin resistance, and serum lipid levels between the subjects with and without the beta(2)-AR gene (Gln27Glu) variant in patients with normal glucose tolerance (NGT), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), or diabetes (DM). The frequency of the beta(2)-AR gene (Gln27Glu) variant tended to increase with worsening of glucose tolerance, but the differences were not statistically significant. Furthermore, there were no differences in the frequency of the beta(2)-AR gene variant in either males or females with obesity (body mass index [BMI], > or = 25.2). Even in Japanese-Americans, who have a more westernized life style than Japanese, the association of the beta(2)-AR gene (Gln27Glu) variant with the parameters of obesity, insulin resistance, and serum lipid level has yet to be clarified.

Several dosages have been reported but the dosage that maximally stimulates insulin secretion in cats has not been determined nor has it been compared in lean and obese animals. IVGTTs were performed in 4 lean and 4 obese spayed female cats with 5 glucose dosages: 0.3 (A), 0.5 (B), 0.8 (C), 1.0 (D). and 1.3 (E) g/kg body weight (BW). Each cat received each dosage in a random design. The glucose disposal rate was significantly different only between lean and obese cats at the highest glucose dosage. The area under the curve for insulin increased significantly among A, B, C, and D in lean and among A, B, and C in obese cats but not between D and E in lean and among C, D, and E in obese cats. Baseline insulin secretion was significantly higher (P = .03) and 1st peak insulin secretion was approximately 50% lower in obese as compared to lean cats (P = .03). Lean but not obese cats reached baseline insulin concentrations at all dosages at 120 minutes. We conclude that the glucose dosage for maximal insulin secretion is 1.0 g/ kg BW in lean and 0.8 g/kg BW in obese cats, supporting routine use of 1 g/kg BW to maximally stimulate insulin secretion regardless of body composition. Obese cats showed an abnormal insulin secretion pattern, indicating a defect in insulin secretion with obesity and insulin resistance.",,"Animals;Blood Glucose/drug effects*;Cat Diseases/blood*;Cats;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Female;Glucose/administration & dosage*:pharmacology*;Glucose Tolerance Test/veterinary*;Insulin/blood:secretion;Obesity/blood*;Thinness/blood*;Time Factors","Clinical Trial,Journal Article",Journal of veterinary internal medicine / American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine,"Blood Glucose,Insulin,Glucose"

Rapid and essentially synchronous vitamin A deficiency was induced by the withdrawal of retinoic acid from mature (190--210 g) stringently vitamin A-deficient male rats reared by feeding early growth plateau (60--70 g) vitamin A-deprived rats diets first supplemented with and then lacking in 2 micrograms retinoic acid per gram diet in repeating 18 day:10 day supplementation:deprivation cycles. Growth was depressed within 1 to 2 days of the withdrawal of retinoic aicid whether animals were force-fed or were fed ad libitum. Similar patterns were obtained when animals were fed 5 or 10 micrograms retinoic acid per gram diet. Appetite was depressed (1--2 days) whether animals were fed 18% casein diets, or were given 10% dextrose drinking solutions only. Decreased food intake was not due to impaired taste function or to poor palatability of the deficient diet. Bilateral electrolytic lesions in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus or anterior prepyriform cortex failed to prevent or to delay loss of appetite. Supplementation with antibiotics decreased body weight losses in the late stages of deficiency and increased survival time. Other signs of deficiency (days until onset following retinoate withdrawal; percent incidence) were: decreased intestinal goblet cell numbers (2--3; 80), decreased pilocarpine induced salivation (6--8; 80), tracheal metaplasia (6--8; 80), transient periocular porphyria (6--8; 60), altered salivary gland morphology (9--10; 80), decreased stomach emptying in force-fed animals (12; 70), twisting (12; 5) and leg crippling (12; 5).

We recently identified a novel alternatively spliced, developmentally regulated oligodendrocyte-specific protein designated microtubule-associated protein-2+13 [microtubule-associated protein-2 expressing exon 13 (MAP-2+13)]. MAP-2+13 is expressed in human fetal oligodendrocytes during process extension and myelination but is minimally expressed in normal mature CNS. To test the hypothesis that MAP-2+13 is reexpressed in regenerating oligodendrocytes in MS lesions, we examined the brains of MS patients for the expression of this protein. By immunocytochemistry using a series of monoclonal antibodies specific for MAP-2+13, we determined that MAP-2+13 expression was up-regulated in all 31 lesions from 10 different MS brains.

919,920.0,11160387.0,Cerebellar Diseases,Ataxia;Tremor,None,0,0,Rocker is a new variant of the voltage-dependent calcium channel gene Cacna1a.,"Rocker (gene symbol rkr), a new neurological mutant phenotype, was found in descendents of a chemically mutagenized male mouse. Mutant mice display an ataxic, unstable gait accompanied by an intention tremor, typical of cerebellar dysfunction. These mice are fertile and appear to have a normal life span. Segregation analysis reveals rocker to be an autosomal recessive trait. The overall cytoarchitecture of the young adult brain appears normal, including its gross cerebellar morphology. Golgi-Cox staining, however, reveals dendritic abnormalities in the mature cerebellar cortex characterized by a reduction of branching in the Purkinje cell dendritic arbor and a ""weeping willow"" appearance of the secondary branches. Using simple sequence length polymorphism markers, the rocker locus was mapped to mouse chromosome 8 within 2 centimorgans of the calcium channel alpha1a subunit (Cacna1a, formerly known as tottering) locus. Complementation tests with the leaner mutant allele (Cacna1a(la)) produced mutant animals, thus identifying rocker as a new allele of Cacna1a (Cacna1a(rkr)). Sequence analysis of the cDNA revealed rocker to be a point mutation resulting in an amino acid exchange: T1310K between transmembrane regions 5 and 6 in the third homologous domain. Important distinctions between rocker and the previously characterized alleles of this locus include the absence of aberrant tyrosine hydroxylase expression in Purkinje cells and the separation of the absence seizures (spike/wave type discharges) from the paroxysmal dyskinesia phenotype. Overall these findings point to an important dissociation between the seizure phenotypes and the abnormalities in catecholamine metabolism, and they emphasize the value of allelic series in the study of gene function.",2001-Feb-15,"Alleles;Animals;Ataxia/etiology;Calcium Channels/genetics*:metabolism*;Calcium Channels, P-Type;Calcium Channels, Q-Type;Cerebellar Diseases/genetics*:pathology:physiopathology;Cerebellum/pathology:physiopathology;Chromosome Mapping;Crosses, Genetic;DNA Mutational Analysis;Female;Genes, Recessive;Genetic Complementation Test;Genetic Linkage/physiology;Genetic Markers;Male;Mice;Mice, Inbred C3H;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Mice, Neurologic Mutants;Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics;Point Mutation;Purkinje Cells/pathology;Tremor/etiology","Journal Article,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,"Calcium Channels,Calcium Channels, P-Type,Calcium Channels, Q-Type,Genetic Markers,Nerve Tissue Proteins,voltage-dependent calcium channel (P-Q type)"

Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an autoimmune disease in which approximately 60-80% of patients have anti-platelet antibodies directed against specific platelet glycoprotein complexes (GPCs) located on their membrane: GP IIb/IIIa, GPIb/IX, and GPIa/IIa. Almost all (95-100%) of the antibody-positive patients have antibodies directed against GPIIb/IIIa alone, or in combination with other glycoprotein targets. Our objective was to determine the specificities of the anti-platelet antibodies in CSS patients. The detection of anti-platelet antibodies was performed using a commercially available ELISA, the Pak-AUTO (GTI, Brookfield, WI), in which highly purified GPIIb/IIIa, GPIb/IX, and GPIa/IIa are immobilized on microtitre plates, incubated with serum or plasma, and subsequently developed with an antihuman polyclonal immunoglobulin. Of 14 CSS patients tested, 11 (79%) had anti-platelet antibodies in their serum directed toward at least one of the three major GPC, nine (82%) of which were against GPIIb/IIIa alone or in combination. Antibodies detected in the sera of ITP patients had similar specificities. No such antibodies were detected in samples from 25 consecutive normal controls.

Children reported pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS) in day surgery and then daily at home for 7 days. Parents reported outcomes of surgery, including fluid intake, nausea, vomiting and sleep disturbances. They also recorded analgesic administration. Three main results related to extent and duration of pain, quality of management of pain, and effect of pain on utilization of health services.

Pain followed a trajectory of intense or moderately intense pain for the first 3 days followed by a gradual decline over the next 4 days.

History, etiology, anatomy and diagnosis of herniated inter-vertebral disc are reviewed. The straight leg raising exam is a well accepted test in the diagnosis of lumbar disc herniation. In the post-operative patients, the results of the straight leg raising test are affected by the presence of scar and fibrosis around the lumbar root(s) involved. The mechanisms by which perineural fibrosis and adhesions change and compromise the neural dynamics and causes symptoms to recur in the post-operative patient are discussed. Due to its dramatic clinical relevance, prevention of periradicular fibrosis has high priority in the surgical management of herniated lumbar disc.

A high prevalence of sleep disturbances in PD patients was found; this is to a large extent probably the result of aging. As compared with controls, patients had a more severely disturbed sleep maintenance because of nycturia, pain, stiffness, and problems with turning in bed. The prevalence of excessive dreaming is similar in both groups, but altered dream experiences almost exclusively occurred in PD. Patients rated themselves more often to be morning-types than controls. This finding may account for the reported adaptation effects in experimental settings and the reduced REM latency in PD patients. The prevalence of daytime sleepiness was similar in both groups. Excessive daytime sleepiness showed a clear diurnal pattern with a peak in the early afternoon.

A placebo-controlled treatment trial with zinc sulphate was made in 15 patients with compensated cirrhosis in order to ascertain whether zinc deficiency caused taste alterations. Taste detection of salty, sweet and acid tastants was significantly impaired in all cirrhotic patients in comparison with normal subjects. TDTs were not influenced either by the etiology or the severity of the disease. All groups of patients had low plasma zinc levels and decompensated cirrhosis had a significantly increased urinary output of zinc.

We demonstrated that it might be attributable to delayed recovery of phase III activity of the gastric migrating motor complex due to low concentrations of plasma motilin caused by resection of the duodenum. Leucine 13-motilin is effective for treating gastric stasis, but it is not yet available for clinical use. Whether erythromycin would improve early gastric stasis after PPPD was tested clinically and by manometry. A manometric tube assembly and a gastrostomy tube were inserted in the stomach of 10 patients at PPPD for pressure recording from the gastric antrum and jejunum and for gastric juice drainage, respectively. After baseline recording, erythromycin 5 mg/kg was given intravenously on day 14 and saline as a placebo on day 17 every 4 hours four times a day. The daily volume of gastric juice output and the gastric motility index were measured. The mean period until the return of gastric phase III was 31 +/- 1 days. Erythromycin significantly increased the gastric motility index from 7.9 +/- 1.3 mmHg to 15.7 +/- 1.8 mmHg (p = 0.0005), whereas saline did not (7.2 +/- 1.6 mmHg to 6.5 +/- 1.2 mmHg; p = 0.21). Erythromycin significantly decreased the gastric juice output from 1,080 +/- 190 ml to 738 +/- 199 ml (p < 0.0001), but the saline injections did not (1,064 +/- 174 ml to 1,115 +/- 189 ml; p = 0.35).

The two first syndromes are well-known. They are periodical and hormonal treatment is relevant in premenstrual syndrome (all forms of progesterone and provascular treatment). Chronic pelvic congestion syndrome or fibrous congestion is linked with fibrous changes of the subperitoneal cellular tissue after more or less lasting chronic congestion. It is sometimes secondary to low noised and unknown sepsis (Bret and De Brux fibro-sclerous pelviperitonis). It is usually linked with the traumatical rupture of cellular pelvic tissue from obstetrical etiology (Masters and Allen syndrome).

In the present study, we investigated whether the influence of word-form similarity on word recognition holds in the visual modality and with the patterns of visual phonetic similarity. Deaf and hearing participants identified isolated spoken words presented visually on a video monitor. On the basis of computational modeling of the lexicon from visual confusion matrices of visual speech syllables, words were chosen to vary in visual phonetic distinctiveness, ranging from visually unambiguous (lexical equivalence class [LEC] size of 1) to highly confusable (LEC size greater than 10). Identification accuracy was found to be highly related to the word LEC size and frequency of occurrence in English. Deaf and hearing participants did not differ in their sensitivity to word LEC size and frequency. The results indicate that visual spoken word recognition shows strong similarities with its auditory counterpart in that the same dependencies on lexical similarity and word frequency are found to influence visual speech recognition accuracy. In particular, the results suggest that stimulus-based lexical distinctiveness is a valid construct to describe the underlying machinery of both visual and auditory spoken word recognition.",2002-May,Adult;Deafness/psychology*;Discrimination Learning;Female;Humans;Male;Mental Recall*;Phonetics*;Reading*;Reproducibility of Results;Semantics*;Speech Acoustics;Speech Perception*,"Journal Article,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",Perception & psychophysics,

(rhGH), recombinant human insulin-like growth factor type 1 (rhIGF-1), or the
combination, in patients with moderately advanced HIV infection.
DESIGN: Randomized but not blinded trial.
SETTING: Government medical research center.
PATIENTS: Twenty-four HIV-infected patients with CD4 cell counts of 100-400 x
10(6)/l who were receiving nucleoside antiretroviral therapy.
INTERVENTIONS: Either rhGH, rhIGF-1, or the combination was administered
subcutaneously for 12 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Immunologic parameters, including T-cell subsets and
assays of in vitro interleukin (IL)-2 production in response to antigens and
mitogens, and safety profile.
RESULTS: Plasma IGF-1 levels were low or low-normal prior to treatment and
increased with all three therapies. There were no significant changes in CD4 cell
counts, RA/RO CD4 cell subsets, natural killer cell function, immunoglobulin
levels, or in vitro IL-2 production in response to mitogen or alloantigens.
However, there was an upward trend (and for p18IIIB a statistically significant
increase) in the in vitro IL-2 production in response to each of five HIV
envelope peptides. Potential toxic effects included fatigue, arthralgia, edema,
myalgia, and headache. Patients also were noted to have weight gain averaging 4
kg early in the course of treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that treatment with rhGH/rhIGF-1 was
reasonably well tolerated and that modest improvement in HIV-specific immune
function was attained. Further studies will help clarify the therapeutic
potential of rhGH/rhIGF-1 as an immunostimulator in the setting of HIV infection.",1998-May-28,"Adult;Body Weight;CD4 Lymphocyte Count;Female;HIV Core Protein p24/blood;HIV Infections/drug therapy:immunology*;Human Growth Hormone/adverse effects:blood:therapeutic use*;Humans;Immunoglobulins/blood;Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/adverse effects:analysis:therapeutic use*;Interleukin-2/biosynthesis;Killer Cells, Natural/immunology;Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology;Male;Middle Aged;Pilot Projects;Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use;T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology;T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/physiology","Clinical Trial,Journal Article,Randomized Controlled Trial,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","AIDS (London, England)","HIV Core Protein p24,Immunoglobulins,Interleukin-2,Recombinant Proteins,Human Growth Hormone,Insulin-Like Growth Factor I"

Three patients with MTX-induced pneumonitis and 10 patients with sustained cough unassociated with pneumonitis were examined clinically, by pulmonary function testing, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). In MTX pneumonitis, cough was associated with progressive dyspnoea, constitutional symptoms, impaired pulmonary function, and interstitial infiltration of variable degree by chest X-ray. BAL cytology invariably showed lymphocytic alveolitis while transbronchial biopsy revealed active interstitial inflammation in only one patient. Ten patients had sustained, nonprogressive cough in the absence of constitutional symptoms, progressive dyspnoea and impaired pulmonary function. Neither X-ray nor BAL nor transbronchial biopsy revealed any evidence of interstitial lung disease. In the majority of these patients, cough abated with symptomatic treatment with or without temporary discontinuation of MTX.

These include prematurity, operative stress, critical illness, and sepsis. The nutritional management of surgical infants with congenital or acquired intestinal abnormalities has improved after the introduction of parenteral nutrition. This article is focused on the energy and protein metabolism of surgical neonates with particular reference to the metabolic response to operative trauma and sepsis. The metabolic utilization of intravenous nutrients also is discussed. The metabolic response to operative trauma is different between neonates and adults. Infants have high rates of protein turnover and are avid retainers of nitrogen. Energy expenditure increases only transiently (4 to 6 hours) after major surgery in neonates. Protein turnover and catabolism seems not to be affected by major operative procedures in neonates. In neonates on parenteral nutrition, carbohydrate and fat have an equivalent effect on protein metabolism. The main determinants of fat utilization are carbohydrate intake and resting energy expenditure. Parenteral nutrition in surgical neonates is associated with increased production of oxygen-free radicals. This seems to be related to intravenous fat administration. Promoting fat utilization by reducing the carbohydrate to fat ratio in the intravenous diet reduces free radical activity to a similar extent as fat exclusion. Glutamine appears to be safe for use in neonates and infants and is ""conditionally essential"" in very-low birth weight infants and in septic neonates. Enteral glutamine supplementation in very-low birth weight infants reduces the risk of sepsis. The metabolism of surgical neonates is affected by operative trauma, critical illness, and sepsis. Nutritional support in surgical neonates has a profound impact on outcome. Exogenous glutamine can modulate immune, metabolic, and inflammatory responses.

Huntington's disease is a most popular disorder exhibiting choreic movements, in which the rather selective striatal degeneration is postulated to be responsible for the generation of choreic movements. In this respect, we have recently produced an experimental model of choreic movements in monkey by combined methods of kainic acid injection into the unilateral striatum and the oral administration of L-DOPA. The purpose of this paper is to summarize our experiment and to review the previous papers on experimental model of choreic movements in order to shed light on the underlying mechanisms of choreic movements. There are at least following three possible mechanisms in the generation of choreic movement. 1) A massive loss of GABAergic inhibitory neurones in the striatum induces disinhibitory effects on nigral dopaminergic neurones, which causes activation of dopaminergic neurones and choreic movements. However, a loss of GABA in the nigra does not always correlate with the generation of choreic movements. 2) A hypersensitive receptors for dopamine in the striatum may cause choreic movements. In fact, however, dopamine receptors are decreased or normal rather than increased not only in Huntington's disease but also in monkey models. 3) A massive loss of neurones in the striatum causes a loss of post-synaptic components of dopaminergic terminals. This may further cause rearrangements and compensatory changes in dopaminergic terminals in the spared striatum. These changes may activate pre-synaptic dopaminergic components which are further activated by the administration of L-DOPA. This hypothesis is mainly derived from the experimental model in monkey.",1989-Dec,"Animals;Chorea/metabolism:physiopathology*;Corpus Striatum/metabolism:physiopathology;Disease Models, Animal;Dopamine/metabolism:physiology*;Haplorhini;Receptors, Dopamine/metabolism;Substantia Nigra/physiopathology","English Abstract,Journal Article,Review","Rinshō shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology ","Receptors, Dopamine"

Whether, and to what extent, FL and CED are overlapping quantities in chronic asthma has not yet been defined. Forty consecutive clinically stable asthmatic patients without smoking history or cardiopulmonary disorders, were studied. In each subject respiratory function, including static and dynamic pulmonary volumes, was evaluated; maximal (MEFV) and partial (PEFV) expiratory V'-V curves and isovolumic partial to maximal flow ratio (M/P). FL was assessed in a seated patient by comparing tidal and PEFV curves; FL was detected when tidal flows were superimposed or exceeded those obtained during PEFV curves, and was expressed as a percentage of the expired control tidal volume (V(T)) affected by flow limitation (FL% VT). Dyspnoea was assessed by both MRC scale and Baseline Dyspnoea Index (BDI) focal score. Half of the patients were found to have FL. They were older, more dyspnoeic and more obstructed (P<0.03 - P<0.000005) than the non-FL group. FEV1, vital capacity (VC), age, body mass index, FL and M/P ratio were all related to dyspnoea scores. FL was significantly related to FEV1 (r = - 0.59). Multiple regression analysis showed that FEV1 (P=0.003, r2= 15-3% and P = 0.004, r2= 20.3%) and age (P = 0.0006, r2 = 26.8% and P = 0.016, r2 = 11%) independently predicted a part of the variance of MRC (P = 0.0001, r2 = 42.1%) and BDI (P = 0.0008, r2 = 31.3%), respectively. With dyspnoea scale being the gold standard, diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) by ROC (receiver operating characteristics) analysis was similar for FEV1 and FL. The results indicate that FL may be present in this subset of asthmatics. CED may not be easily explained by abnormalities of routine spirometry or FL, the largest part of the CED variance remained unexplained. Thus, routine spirometry, FL and CED in patients with bronchial asthma are only partially overlapping quantities which need to be assessed separately.",2000-Jul,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Airway Obstruction/complications:physiopathology;Asthma/complications*:physiopathology;Chronic Disease;Cross-Sectional Studies;Dyspnea/etiology*:physiopathology;Female;Forced Expiratory Volume/physiology;Humans;Lung Diseases, Obstructive/complications*:physiopathology;Male;Middle Aged;Total Lung Capacity/physiology;Vital Capacity/physiology",Journal Article,Respiratory medicine,

A characteristic two-phase lung injury was seen after administration of endotoxin with an initial hypertension phase, characterized by pulmonary artery hypertension, and a second or permeability phase, characterized by an increase in protein-rich lymph flow. all eight animals that underwent only endotoxin administration survived, whereas four of the nine burned animals died during the permeability phase in pulmonary edema. Major physiologic differences between the groups were noted during the permeability phase, including a more severe hypoxia, pulmonary hypertension, and increased postburn lymph flow. Major biochemical changes included significant increases in lymph thromboxane, thromboxane B2, and beta-glucuronidase activity in the burn group.

Various review papers suggest that no single treatment procedure is universally effective. Although there may be many reasons for this finding, one could be that people engage in these behaviors for various reasons, and that procedures that are incompatible with the cause of the behavior are unlikely to be effective. These studies also suggest many hypotheses for the development and maintenance of these behaviors, three of which are the self-stimulation, positive reinforcement, and negative reinforcement hypotheses. The purpose of this paper was to determine whether one of these hypotheses could be matched to the cause of the behavior and used as an effective treatment procedure. We therefore compared one hypothesis with one other for 3 subjects in a three-phase study. During baseline, data were taken in two classrooms for each subject, and a judgement was made about the hypothesis most likely to be related to the cause of the behavior. During the second phase, a treatment based on that hypothesis was used in one classroom, and a treatment based on another hypothesis was used in the second classroom. During the third phase, the treatment that was most effective in the second phase was used in both classrooms.

At 24h following surgery, 504 patients, who were receiving i.v. morphine via patient-controlled analgesia, completed the pain intensity measures and the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) in a randomized order.

The amount of opioid self-administered was recorded. Age differences in postoperative pain intensity were not found. However, elderly patients obtained lower MPQ scores and self-administered less morphine than younger people. Psychometric analyses suggested that the NRS was the preferred pain intensity scale. It had low error rates, and higher face, convergent, divergent and criterion validity than the other scales. Most importantly, its properties were not age-related. The VDS also had a favourable profile with low error rates and good face, convergent and criterion validity.

Various degrees of extradural compression were used to induce mild, moderate or severe compression injuries. Furthermore, a locomotor rating scale was developed by which the functional outcome of the spinal cord injury could be assessed. The introduction of such a model will be useful for further studies on the pathogenesis and treatment strategies of spinal cord injury. To assess hindlimb motor function, a 10-point scale was used. Initially, the animals were allowed to move freely in an open field and were rated 0-5, 0 being no movement and 5 being almost normal. Animals scoring a 5 were then assessed using steel bars with decreasing widths from 2 cm to 5 mm. For each bar successfully crossed over, they gained additional points. Before injury the hindlimb motor function score (MFS) in all the animals was 10. In mice with mild compression, MFS was decreased slightly on day 1 and recovered to 9 +/- 0.6 on day 14. For mice with moderate compression, the MFS decreased to 4.6 +/- 0.4 on day 1 after injury and gradually improved to 8.1 +/- 0.6 on day 14. Severe injury resulted in paraplegia of the hindlimbs day 1 after injury with a score of 0.6 +/- 0.2. By day 14 after injury, these animals gradually recovered to 3.9 +/- 0.1, could bear the weight on the hindlimbs and walk with a severe deficit. There was a 3%, 9% and 19% decrease in the total cross-sectional area of the spinal cord 14 days after mild, moderate and severe injury, respectively. Microtubule-associated protein immunostaining revealed that the gray matter decreased to 61 +/- 7% in moderately injured animals, while severe compression resulted in a complete loss of gray matter. White matter decreased to 86 +/- 6% in moderately injured animals and 29 +/- 11% in severely injured animals. This study shows that the mouse can be used to achieve reproducible spinal cord compression injuries of various degrees of severity.

Thus, overnight recordings of laryngeal sounds and heart rate by a portable device (MESAM) and of Sao2 by oximetry are applicable to screen outpatients for the presence of OSAS. Computerized analysis for time intervals of constant heart rate and intervals between snoring sounds is used by MESAM to quantify respiratory disturbances during sleep. Rapid increases in Sao2 during the postapnoeic hyperventilation period together with the number of desaturations are used by a new software for quantitative analysis of oximetry. To elucidate reliability of results from automatically scored MESAM and oximetry recordings, we compared the four computer calculated respiratory disturbance indices from heart rate (RDIH), snoring (RDIS), resaturations (RDIR) and desaturations (RDID) with the apnoea plus hypopnoea index (AHI) from simultaneously performed polysomnography. The study population consisted of 53 snorers with an AHI of 19.0 +/- 2.6 (median +/- SEM; range 0.7-87.8).
