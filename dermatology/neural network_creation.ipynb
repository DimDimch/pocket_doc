Automated classification of skin lesions using images is a challenging task owing to the fine-grained variability in the appearance of skin lesions.\n\nThis the **HAM10000 (\"Human Against Machine with 10000 training images\")** dataset.It consists of 10015 dermatoscopicimages which are released as a training set for academic machine learning purposes and are publiclyavailable through the ISIC archive. This benchmark dataset can be used for machine learning and for comparisons with human experts. \n\nIt has 7 different classes of skin cancer which are listed below :<br>\n**1. Melanocytic nevi <br>**\n**2. Melanoma <br>**\n**3. Benign keratosis-like lesions <br>**\n**4. Basal cell carcinoma <br>**\n**5. Actinic keratoses <br>**\n**6. Vascular lesions <br>**\n**7.

It is like a set of learnable filters. I choosed to set 32 filters for the two firsts conv2D layers and 64 filters for the two last ones. Each filter transforms a part of the image (defined by the kernel size) using the kernel filter. The kernel filter matrix is applied on the whole image. Filters can be seen as a transformation of the image.\n\nThe CNN can isolate features that are useful everywhere from these transformed images (feature maps).\n\nThe second important layer in CNN is the pooling (MaxPool2D) layer. This layer simply acts as a downsampling filter. It looks at the 2 neighboring pixels and picks the maximal value. These are used to reduce computational cost, and to some extent also reduce overfitting. We have to choose the pooling size (i.e the area size pooled each time) more the pooling dimension is high, more the downsampling is important.\n\nCombining convolutional and pooling layers, CNN are able to combine local features and learn more global features of the image.\n\nDropout is a regularization method, where a proportion of nodes in the layer are randomly ignored (setting their wieghts to zero) for each training sample. This drops randomly a propotion of the network and forces the network to learn features in a distributed way. This technique also improves generalization and reduces the overfitting.\n\n'relu' is the rectifier (activation function max(0,x). The rectifier activation function is used to add non linearity to the network.\n\nThe Flatten layer is use to convert the final feature maps into a one single 1D vector. This flattening step is needed so that you can make use of fully connected layers after some convolutional/maxpool layers. It combines all the found local features of the previous convolutional layers.\n\nIn the end i used the features in two fully-connected (Dense) layers which is just artificial an neural networks (ANN) classifier.

It is the error rate between the oberved labels and the predicted ones. We use a specific form for categorical classifications (>2 classes) called the \"categorical_crossentropy\".\nThe most important function is the optimizer. This function will iteratively improve parameters (filters kernel values, weights and bias of neurons ...) in order to minimise the loss.\nI choosed Adam optimizer because it combines the advantages of two other extensions of stochastic gradient descent. Specifically:\n\n1. Adaptive Gradient Algorithm (AdaGrad) that maintains a per-parameter learning rate that improves performance on problems with sparse gradients (e.g. natural language and computer vision problems).\n\n2. Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp) that also maintains per-parameter learning rates that are adapted based on the average of recent magnitudes of the gradients for the weight (e.g. how quickly it is changing). This means the algorithm does well on online and non-stationary problems (e.g. noisy).\n\nAdam realizes the benefits of both AdaGrad and RMSProp.\n\nAdam is a popular algorithm in the field of deep learning because it achieves good results fast.\n\nThe metric function \"accuracy\" is used is to evaluate the performance our model. This metric function is similar to the loss function, except that the results from the metric evaluation are not used when training the model (only for evaluation)."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"c754af8f1d34d3cfb6adb93e6824b5a5e6dc8506"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Define the optimizer\noptimizer = Adam(lr=0.001, beta_1=0.9, beta_2=0.999, epsilon=None, decay=0.0, amsgrad=False)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"c34b677f1a804669e6e01042d0f15b3f29675e1b"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Compile the model\nmodel.compile(optimizer = optimizer , loss = \"categorical_crossentropy\", metrics=[\"accuracy\"])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"11526af016938dab9e9799cdb13fae7f353ca7fb"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Set a learning rate annealer\nlearning_rate_reduction = ReduceLROnPlateau(monitor='val_acc', \n                                            patience=3, \n                                            verbose=1, \n                                            factor=0.5, \n                                            min_lr=0.00001)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"ee70861394de8ca8bea6d611ffbe8dd8d9d3b9f2"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In order to make the optimizer converge faster and closest to the global minimum of the loss function, i used an annealing method of the learning rate (LR).\n\nThe LR is the step by which the optimizer walks through the 'loss landscape'.
